## Pain points we address from competitor reviews
- “Too many steps to schedule or invoice” → fewer, smarter steps with automation defaults
- “Techs can’t see what they actually need” → checklists, photos, required skills on jobs
- “Partial invoices are confusing” → progress billing with clear deposit‑to‑balance math (Phase 3)
- “Scheduling doesn’t respect skill levels” → skills + required levels + capacity guard
- “UI feels inconsistent” → unified, responsive components and industry‑standard patterns

## What’s included today (Beta)
- Quotes → Jobs → Invoices pipeline with auto‑invoice on completion
- Calendar scheduling with overbooking guards and capacity per tech
- Customer portal foundation (quotes, jobs, invoices)
- Inventory fundamentals (items, stock, transfers)
- Company/employee management, permissions, and settings

## Near‑term roadmap (Next 4–8 weeks)
- Field execution pack (Phase 2)
  - Per‑job checklists, photo capture, signature on completion, closeout PDF
- Progress/partial invoicing groundwork (Phase 3)

  - Skills catalog UI, required job skills UI, auto‑suggestions with fairness and travel time
- Reporting & KPIs v1
  - Quote win rate, job cycle times, team utilization, revenue snapshot

## Integrations
- Core app works standalone for beta launch. Select integrations will arrive post‑beta based on demand (payments, messaging, calendars). We prioritize stability and end‑to‑end flow first.

## Security & privacy
- Sensible defaults during beta (RLS disabled for speed of development). Hardened permissions and RLS will be enabled ahead of GA.

## Why now
- Market incumbents are either too “heavy” and expensive, or too “light” and fragmented. TradeMate Pro hits the practical middle: the features trades use daily, delivered with speed, coherence, and value.
