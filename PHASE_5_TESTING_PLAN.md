# 🧪 PHASE 5: Verification & Testing Plan

## Overview

Phase 5 involves testing all updated components to ensure RPC functions work correctly. This is a comprehensive testing plan for the consolidation.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Manual Testing (Recommended First)
Start the dev server and manually test each component:

```bash
npm start
```

Then navigate to each page and verify functionality.

### 2. Automated Testing (Optional)
Run automated tests to verify RPC functions work.

## Browser Console Verification

### What to Check
1. ✅ No red errors in console
2. ✅ No warnings about missing data
3. ✅ RPC function calls logged correctly
4. ✅ Data returned from RPC functions

### How to Check
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any errors or warnings
4. Check Network tab for RPC calls

### Expected Console Output
```
✅ CALENDAR - Loading schedulable employees via RPC for company: [company-id]
✅ CALENDAR - Loaded employees via RPC: [array of employees]
✅ CALENDAR - Loaded backlog via RPC: [array of work orders]
```

---

## Network Tab Verification

### What to Check
1. ✅ RPC function calls are being made
2. ✅ Responses are successful (200 status)
3. ✅ Response data is correct

### How to Check
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "rpc" or "supabase"
4. Look for RPC function calls

### Expected Network Calls
```
POST /rest/v1/rpc/get_schedulable_employees
POST /rest/v1/rpc/get_unscheduled_work_orders
POST /rest/v1/rpc/get_work_orders_by_status
```

---

## Performance Verification

### What to Check
1. ✅ Pages load quickly (< 2 seconds)
2. ✅ No lag when interacting with components
3. ✅ Smooth animations and transitions

### How to Check
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Record page load
4. Check for long tasks or bottlenecks

### Expected Performance

- ✅ RPC calls: < 500ms
- ✅ UI interactions: < 100ms

---

## Error Handling Verification
