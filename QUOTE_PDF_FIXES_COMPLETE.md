# Quote PDF Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ PDF Shows Wrong Pricing Model
**Problem**: Quote with `pricing_model='PERCENTAGE'` (27.5% of $5,150.57) was showing "Time and Materials" line items in PDF (Labor 1, 8 × $75.00 = $600.00).

**Root Cause**: PDF service only displayed line items from `work_order_line_items` table, ignoring the `pricing_model` field.

**Fix Applied**: Updated `QuotePDFService.exportHtml()` to check `pricing_model` and render appropriate content for each model type.

**Supported Pricing Models**:
- ✅ **PERCENTAGE**: Shows base amount and percentage calculation
- ✅ **FLAT_RATE**: Shows flat rate amount
- ✅ **UNIT**: Shows unit count and price per unit
- ✅ **MILESTONE**: Shows milestone breakdown with amounts and percentages
- ✅ **RECURRING**: Shows recurring rate, billing frequency, and total contract value
- ✅ **TIME_MATERIALS**: Shows line items table (original behavior)

**Example PDF Output for PERCENTAGE**:
```
Pricing Model: Percentage of Base Amount

Base Amount:                          $5,150.57
Percentage:                           27.5%
                                      ----------
Subtotal                              $1,416.41
Tax                                   $116.85
Total Quote                           $1,533.26
```

### 2. ✅ "Save & Download PDF" Does Nothing
**Problem**: Button said "Opened successfully" but PDF window closed immediately, nothing to download.

**Root Cause**: The `openPrintable()` function was designed for **printing**, not previewing. It opened a window, triggered print dialog, then auto-closed after 800ms.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Created new `previewPDF()` function that opens PDF in new tab **without auto-closing**
- Updated all PDF buttons to use `previewPDF()` instead of `openPrintable()`
- Kept `openPrintable()` for future print functionality

**New Functions**:
```javascript
// Preview PDF in new tab (doesn't auto-close)
async previewPDF(companyId, quoteId) {
  const html = this.exportHtml(company, quote, items, customer);
  const w = window.open('', '_blank');
  if (w) {
    w.document.write(html);
    w.document.close();
    w.focus();  // ✅ No auto-close!
  }
}

// Print PDF (opens print dialog, then closes)
async openPrintable(companyId, quoteId) {
  // ... same as before with auto-close
}
```

**Result**: PDF now opens in new tab and stays open. User can:
- View the PDF
- Use browser's "Save as PDF" (Ctrl+P → Save as PDF)
- Print if needed
- Close when done

### 3. ✅ Modal Data Saved Successfully
**Verification**: The presented modal data you entered (presented_by, customer_reaction, etc.) was successfully saved to the database with the new columns we added earlier.

**What Was Saved**:
- `status` = 'presented'
- `presented_date` = Date you selected
- `presented_time` = Time you selected
- `presented_by` = Name you entered
- `customer_reaction` = Reaction you selected
- `next_steps` = Next steps you entered
- `presented_notes` = Notes you entered

2. ✅ `src/pages/QuotesPro.js` - Changed to use `previewPDF()` instead of `openPrintable()`
3. ✅ Build completed successfully
