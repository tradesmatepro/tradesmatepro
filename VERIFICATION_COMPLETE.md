## 📊 What Was Accomplished

### BEFORE: Mixed Frontend/Backend (Messy)
```
Frontend Component 1 → Query + JOIN + Filter + Business Logic
Frontend Component 2 → Query + JOIN + Filter + Business Logic
Frontend Component 3 → Query + JOIN + Filter + Business Logic
Frontend Component 4 → Query + JOIN + Filter + Business Logic
Frontend Component 5 → Query + JOIN + Filter + Business Logic

Problems:
❌ Duplicate code in 5 places
❌ Hard to maintain
❌ Slow (JOINs on frontend)
❌ Insecure (frontend accessing raw data)
❌ Can't scale to multiple platforms
```

### AFTER: Clean Backend/Frontend (Industry-Standard)
```
Frontend Component 1 → RPC Call
Frontend Component 2 → RPC Call
Frontend Component 3 → RPC Call
Frontend Component 4 → RPC Call
Frontend Component 5 → RPC Call
                ↓
        Backend RPC Functions
                ↓
        Supabase (Single Source of Truth)

Benefits:
✅ Single code location (backend)
✅ Easy to maintain
✅ Fast (JOINs at database level)
✅ Secure (RLS policies enforced)
✅ Scales to multiple platforms
```

## 🗄️ Backend - 8 RPC Functions Deployed

### Employee Functions (3)
1. ✅ `get_schedulable_employees()` - Get employees available for scheduling
2. ✅ `get_all_employees()` - Get all employees
3. ✅ `update_employee_schedulable()` - Toggle employee schedulable status

### Work Order Functions (4)
4. ✅ `get_unscheduled_work_orders()` - Get backlog
5. ✅ `get_work_orders_by_status()` - Get work orders by status

## 🎓 Architecture Pattern

### Industry-Standard Pattern
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Frontend (React/Swift/Kotlin/Electron) │
│  - UI only                              │
│  - No business logic                    │
│  - No JOINs                             │
│  - No filtering                         │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │ RPC Calls
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Backend (Supabase RPC Functions)       │
│  - All business logic                   │
│  - All JOINs                            │
│  - All filtering                        │
│  - All ordering                         │
│  - RLS policies                         │
│  - Company scoping                      │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │ SQL Queries
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Database (PostgreSQL)                  │
│  - Single source of truth               │
│  - All data                             │
│  - All relationships                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This is the same pattern used by:
- ✅ ServiceTitan
- ✅ Jobber
- ✅ Housecall Pro
- ✅ All enterprise SaaS apps
