⚡ Phase 6 – Integrations (Future Roadmap)
🎯 Purpose

Connect TradeMate Pro with the external ecosystem contractors rely on:

Accounting → QuickBooks, Xero

Payments → Stripe, PayPal, Square

Messaging → Twilio, Slack, MS Teams

Scheduling/GPS → Google Calendar, Maps, Fleet tracking

Automation → Zapier, Make, Webhooks

Textiing- twilio

This makes TradeMate the hub, not a silo.

📋 Core Tables
Table	Purpose
integration_providers	Registry of supported providers (QuickBooks, Twilio, etc.)
integration_accounts	Each company’s connected provider account(s)
integration_tokens	OAuth/API tokens with refresh/expiry
integration_settings	Provider-specific configuration (e.g., sync frequency, field mapping)
integration_field_mappings	Maps TradeMate fields → external system fields
integration_logs	Log of every API call, request, response, and outcome
integration_error_queue	Stores failed syncs for retry or manual resolution
integration_health_checks	Uptime and status of each integration connection
🛠️ Key Features

Authentication & Tokens

OAuth2, API keys, JWTs

Automatic refresh + rotation

Stored securely per company

Field Mapping

Example: work_orders → QuickBooks invoices

Company admins can define mappings

Error Handling

Retry queue for failed syncs

Human-readable error messages

Escalation if repeated failures

Monitoring & Transparency

Integration health dashboard

Success/failure rates

Audit log with timestamps

Security & Permissions

Only admins can connect/disconnect

Role-based access to integration logs/settings

📊 Future Enhancements

Materialized views for sync status dashboards (per company, per provider)

Automatic anomaly detection (flagging repeated failures)

Multi-company integrations (e.g., franchises syncing to a central QuickBooks)

Smart fallback: if integration fails, system still works offline

✅ That’s your Phase 6 “integration skeleton”. It’s enough to prevent drift later — we can expand into columns, enums, constraints, triggers, indexes, and views when we actually build Phase 6.
