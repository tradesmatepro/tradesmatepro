🧾 Phase 5 – Transparency & Cleanup (Proposed)

Focus: trust, compliance, customer confidence

1. Subscription & Billing Transparency

subscription_audit_logs → track plan changes, cancellations, refunds

billing_disputes → structured way to log, track, resolve disputes

Automatic one-click cancel → trigger that downgrades plan but logs reason

2. Marketplace Fairness

lead_refunds → track refunded/credit leads

bid_loss_reasons → structured enum (price_too_high, late_response, reputation)

Transparent lead quality scoring (contractors can see why leads are flagged)

3. Customer Visibility

data_access_logs → who accessed customer data, when, and why

Export functions (GDPR/CCPA “Download My Data”)

Notifications → “Your profile was viewed by X”

4. Performance & Accountability

Public-facing KPIs → win rates, avg response times, average review scores

Transparent algorithm → docs + enums that explain matching rules

compliance_audit → for regulatory or industry standards

5. Cleanup & Optimization

Index tuning & partitioning for long-term scaling

Archival tables (move old jobs, logs > 5 years)

Schema pruning (remove unused/legacy tables from beta/early builds)

🚀 Why Make It Phase 5

Phase 1–4 = functionality & growth

Phase 5 = trust & scale

This is where we outshine competitors by being open about fees, rules, and data.
