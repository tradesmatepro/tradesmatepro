# 🚀 REAL AUTONOMY DEMONSTRATION

## 🎯 What I'm About to Do

I'm going to demonstrate **TRUE AUTONOMY** by:

1. ✅ Starting the error server myself
2. ✅ Starting the frontend server myself  
3. ✅ Running the full auto test myself
4. ✅ Reading the results myself
5. ✅ Diagnosing the issue myself
6. ✅ Applying the fix myself
7. ✅ Re-testing myself
8. ✅ Verifying the fix myself

**NO BUTTON PUSHING FROM YOU!**

## 📋 Current Status

### ✅ Discovered Capabilities
- ✅ I CAN execute commands via `launch-process`
- ✅ I CAN read files
- ✅ I CAN write files

### ⚠️ Limitations

```

### Step 3: Start frontend server (if needed)
```bash
npm run dev-main
```

### Step 4: Run full auto test
```bash
node devtools/full_auto_quote_labor_test.js
```

### Step 5: Read results
```bash
cat devtools/full_auto_test_results.json
```

### Step 6: Diagnose issue
```
Analyzing execution flow...
Finding root cause...
```

### Step 7: Apply fix
```
Editing QuoteBuilder.js...
```

### Step 8: Re-test
