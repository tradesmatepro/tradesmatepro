## 🔐 SECURITY

### How It Works:
1. Customer receives email/SMS with link containing quote ID
2. Customer clicks link → opens `quote.html?id=abc123`
3. JavaScript loads quote from Supabase using quote ID
4. Page only shows quotes with `status='sent'`
5. Customer can approve/reject
6. Database updates to `status='approved'` or `status='rejected'`

### Security Features:
- ✅ Only shows quotes with status='sent' (can't view approved/rejected quotes)
- ✅ Quote ID acts as "secret token" (only email recipients have it)
- ✅ Uses Supabase RLS (Row Level Security)
- ✅ Can't edit quote amounts (read-only display)
- ✅ Can only change status (approve/reject)

### Limitations:
- ⚠️ Anyone with the link can approve/reject (no authentication)
- ⚠️ Links don't expire (quote ID is permanent)

### Future Improvements:
- Add magic link authentication
- Add link expiration
- Add email verification
- Add signature capture
- Add payment integration

## 🎨 CUSTOMIZATION

The HTML file is fully self-contained and easy to customize:

### Change Colors:
```css
/* Line 11-12 in public-quote-portal.html */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
```

### Add Company Logo:
```html
<!-- Add after line 233 -->
<div class="header">
  <img src="https://www.tradesmatepro.com/logo.png" alt="Logo" style="max-width: 200px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <h1>📋 Your Quote</h1>
  ...
</div>
```

### Change Button Text:
```html
<!-- Line 169 -->
<button class="btn btn-approve" onclick="approveQuote()">
  ✅ Accept This Quote
</button>
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Quote not found"
**Cause:** Quote ID is wrong or quote status is not 'sent'  
**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check quote exists and has correct status
SELECT id, status FROM work_orders WHERE id = 'your-quote-id';

-- If status is wrong, update it
UPDATE work_orders SET status = 'sent' WHERE id = 'your-quote-id';
```

### Issue: "Error loading quote"
**Cause:** Supabase connection issue  
**Fix:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check for network errors
- Verify Supabase URL and anon key in HTML file (lines 247-248)

### Issue: Approve button doesn't work
**Cause:** RLS policy blocking update  
**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'work_orders';

-- May need to allow anon users to update quotes with status='sent'
```

### Issue: Page is blank
**Cause:** JavaScript error  
**Fix:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for error messages
- Check if Supabase JS library loaded (line 7)
