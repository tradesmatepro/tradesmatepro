## 🐛 DEBUGGING:

If the wizard doesn't show, open browser console (F12) and look for:

```
=== APPROVAL WIZARD DEBUG ===
Company Settings: {require_signature_on_approval: true, ...}
Adding signature step
Adding terms step
Adding deposit step
Adding schedule step
Total steps: ['review', 'signature', 'terms', 'deposit', 'schedule', 'confirmation']
Showing wizard with steps: ...
```

If you see `Company Settings: null`, the settings didn't load.

WHERE id = 'a83a2550-a46e-4953-b378-9e093bcbe21a';
```

Or use the file: `reset-quote-for-testing.sql`
