# ✅ Industry Standard Workflow - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 **WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:**

```
❌ Approved quotes stayed in Quotes page

```

```
✅ Approved quotes move to Jobs page as "Unscheduled"
✅ Jobs page shows approved/scheduled/in_progress
✅ Clear "Unscheduled Jobs" filter and count
✅ Calendar shows unscheduled backlog
```

```
✅ quote       - Draft quotes
✅ sent        - Sent to customer
✅ rejected    - Customer declined

```

### **JOBS PAGE (Active Jobs):**
