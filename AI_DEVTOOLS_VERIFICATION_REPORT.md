## 🐛 Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue #1: Incorrect Table Name (404 Errors) ✅ FIXED

**Error Message:**
```
GET /rest/v1/work_order_items 404 (Not Found)
Failed to load work_order_items for job 92333880-d0fe-4b21-9310-c1af14ecd4c7: 404
```

**Root Cause:**  
Code was querying `work_order_items` table, but the actual table is named `work_order_line_items`

**Impact:**  
- Jobs page couldn't load line items
- Cost calculations failed
- Invoice creation affected

**Fix Applied:**  
Updated `src/components/JobsDatabasePanel.js`:
- Line 128: Changed `work_order_items` → `work_order_line_items`
- Line 145: Updated error message
- Line 428: Changed `work_order_items` → `work_order_line_items`

**Files Modified:** 1  
**Lines Changed:** 3  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Issue #2: Missing User Profile (406 Errors) ⚠️ IDENTIFIED

**Error Message:**
```
GET /rest/v1/profiles?user_id=eq.44475f47-be87-45ef-b465-2ecbbc0616ea 406 (Not Acceptable)
Profile not found, using defaults
```

**Root Cause:**  
User profile doesn't exist in the `profiles` table for user ID `44475f47-be87-45ef-b465-2ecbbc0616ea`

**Impact:**  
- User preferences not loaded
- Avatar not displayed
- Timezone/language defaults used

**Recommended Fix:**  
1. Create profile for this user, OR
2. Improve error handling to gracefully handle missing profiles

**Status:** ⚠️ IDENTIFIED (Not critical - app handles gracefully)
