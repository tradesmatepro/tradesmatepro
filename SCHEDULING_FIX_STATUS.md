# üîß SCHEDULING FIX STATUS

## ‚úÖ **WHAT WE FIXED:**

### **1. LaborService.js** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Was querying `employees ‚Üí users ‚Üí profiles` (wrong!)

**Fixed:** Now queries `employees ‚Üí users` (correct!)

```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD (WRONG):
'employees?select=*,users!user_id(profiles(first_name,last_name))'

// ‚úÖ NEW (CORRECT):
'employees?select=id,user_id,job_title,hourly_rate,overtime_rate,users(id,first_name,last_name,name,role,status)'
```

---

### **2. JobsDatabasePanel.js** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Was using `assigned_technician_id` (old field)

**Fixed:** Now uses `employee_id` (industry standard!)

---

### **3. Scheduling.js** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Was querying `profiles` table (wrong!)

**Fixed:** Now queries `employees` table joined with `users`

---

## ‚ùå **REMAINING ERRORS IN LOGS:**

### **Error 1: profiles query with status column**
```
GET .../profiles?select=id&status=eq.active 400 ()
```

**Problem:** Something is still querying `profiles` table with `status` column

**Profiles table does NOT have `status` column!**
- `status` is in `users` table
- `profiles` only has UI preferences (avatar_url, timezone, etc.)

**Need to find:** What code is making this query?

---

### **Error 2: Profile not found (406)**
```
GET .../profiles?select=avatar_url,preferences,timezone,language,notification_preferences&user_id=eq.44475f47-be87-45ef-b465-2ecbbc0616ea 406 ()
‚ö†Ô∏è Profile not found, using defaults
```

**This is OK** - just means Jerry Smith doesn't have a profile record yet. The code handles it gracefully with defaults.

## üîç **WHAT'S HAPPENING:**

You said: "its not opening up the smart scheduler its just going to active jobs instead"

**Possible causes:**

1. **Smart Scheduler button is redirecting wrong**
   - Should open Smart Scheduling Assistant modal
   - Instead going to Active Jobs page

2. **Error is preventing modal from opening**
   - The `profiles?select=id&status=eq.active` error might be blocking it

3. **Navigation logic issue**
   - Button click handler might have wrong logic

---

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Find the profiles?status query**

Need to search for code that queries:
```javascript
'profiles?select=id&status=eq.active'
```

This is WRONG because:
- `profiles` table doesn't have `status` column
- Should query `users` table or `employees` table instead

### **Step 2: Check Smart Scheduler button**

Need to see:
- What page are you on?
- What button are you clicking?
- What's the button's onClick handler?

---

## üìù **QUESTIONS FOR YOU:**

1. **What page are you on?**
   - Quotes page?
   - Jobs page?
   - Calendar page?

2. **What button are you clicking?**
   - "Schedule" button on a quote?
   - "Smart Schedule" button?
   - Something else?

3. **What should happen?**
   - Should open Smart Scheduling Assistant modal?
   - Should open calendar?

4. **What is happening instead?**
   - Goes to Active Jobs page?
   - Shows error?
   - Nothing happens?

## üîç **DEBUGGING:**

Let me search for the code that's making the wrong `profiles` query...
