## 🎮 How to Use (For You)

### Option 1: Let Me Work Autonomously
Just say:
> "Read devtools/AI_TEAMMATE_GUIDE.md and debug the OnHold modal issue"

I'll handle everything automatically!

### Option 2: Run Specific Commands
Tell me to send a command:
> "Send a test_pipeline command to run the complete pipeline tests"

I'll write to `ai_commands.json` and read the response.

### Option 3: Check Current Status
> "Check the server status and analyze current errors"

I'll use the `check_status` and `analyze_errors` commands.
