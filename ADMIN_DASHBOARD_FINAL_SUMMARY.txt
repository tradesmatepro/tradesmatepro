ADMIN DASHBOARD - COMPLETE FIX SUMMARY
================================================================================

YOUR PROBLEM (PERFECTLY STATED):
"This is where i said we need to see the whole pipeline cause this happens 
everytime. you change one thing then the others break the next time i create 
a user. and on top of that if one part fails it still writes the rest to 
supabase so now i haeto go into supabase and delete all that other stuff 
manually."

YOU WERE 100% CORRECT. This was a critical architectural flaw.

================================================================================
WHAT WAS WRONG
================================================================================

ISSUE 1: Companies Showing 0 Count
- Admin dashboard showed 0 companies even though they existed
- Root cause: Using anon key instead of service key (RLS filtering)
- FIXED: Now uses admin client to bypass RLS

ISSUE 2: User Creation Failing
- Creating companies failed with schema cache errors
- Root cause: Supabase schema cache out of sync with database
- FIXED: Created schema cache refresh script

ISSUE 3: Orphaned Records on Failure
- When one step failed, others still executed
- Left orphaned records that needed manual cleanup
- FIXED: Implemented atomic transactions with automatic rollback

================================================================================
WHAT WAS FIXED
================================================================================

CODE CHANGES:
‚úÖ admin-dashboard/src/services/CompanyService.js
   - Uses admin client to bypass RLS
   - Changed profile creation from upsert to insert
   - Added all required fields to profile
   - Implemented atomic transaction with rollback
   - Enhanced logging for each step
   - Better error messages

BUILD STATUS:

================================================================================
THE SOLUTION: ATOMIC TRANSACTION PIPELINE
================================================================================

BEFORE (BROKEN):
Step 1: Create auth user ‚úÖ
Step 2: Create company ‚úÖ
Step 3: Create users record ‚úÖ
Step 4: Create profile ‚ùå FAILS
Step 5: Create employee ‚úÖ (STILL RUNS!)
Result: Orphaned records everywhere, manual cleanup required

AFTER (FIXED):
Step 1: Create auth user ‚úÖ
Step 2: Create company ‚úÖ
Step 3: Create users record ‚úÖ
Step 4: Create profile ‚ùå FAILS
       ‚Üí ROLLBACK ALL STEPS
       ‚Üí Delete employee (if created)
       ‚Üí Delete users record
       ‚Üí Delete company
       ‚Üí Delete auth user
Result: Database is clean, clear error message, user can retry immediately

================================================================================
THE 5-TABLE PIPELINE
================================================================================

When creating a company, these tables are populated in order:

1. auth.users (Supabase Auth)
   - Email, password, email_confirmed
   - Required for login

2. companies
   - name, company_number, created_at
   - Top-level business entity

3. users (public.users)
   - auth_user_id (‚Üí auth.users)
   - company_id (‚Üí companies)
   - role, status, first_name, last_name, phone

4. profiles
   - user_id (‚Üí users)
   - first_name, last_name, phone
   - User display information

5. employees
   - user_id (‚Üí users)
   - company_id (‚Üí companies)
   - employee_number, job_title, is_schedulable
   - Required for RLS and scheduling

ALL 5 MUST SUCCEED OR ENTIRE OPERATION ROLLS BACK.

================================================================================
HOW TO USE
================================================================================

STEP 1: Fix Schema Cache (One-Time)
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run: supabase/migrations/010_fix_schema_cache.sql
3. Verify: ‚úÖ Schema cache is working

STEP 2: Create Company
1. Open admin dashboard
2. Click "Create Company"
3. Fill in form
4. Click Submit
5. Check logs for success

STEP 3: If It Fails
- Read detailed error message
- Database is automatically cleaned up
- Retry immediately
