Yes — digging into that Reddit thread surfaces several very real complaints and pain points about Jobber (and similar field service apps). We can use those as features or guardrails in your roadmap so TradesMatePro avoids those traps. Here are the main complaints + how you can turn them into advantages:

🔍 What People Complain About Jobber (From the Reddit Thread)

High pressure sales & pushy onboarding

“Now they are all over me to sign up for the yearly thing which is maybe $100 per month.” 
Reddit

They push users into paid plans too early.

Users feel pressured by sales calls.

Reliability / mobile bugs (especially clock-in/out, photo uploads)

“It doesn’t like Samsung phones though (often won’t clock people out etc).” 
Reddit

Locked-in / data access issues

“When you've closed your Jobber account, they make you resubscribe to see all your old invoices.” 
Reddit

Weak integrations / poor API / limited data flow

“Jobber does not play nice with any other applications … their integration with Zapier and Integrately is BASIC info contact info, that’s it.” 
Reddit

“If you sync your calendar … it’s one way … you can’t track conversion properly or integrate deeply.” 
Reddit

Poor marketing / no tracking of leads

“They don’t even allow you to add your Google Tag or Meta Pixel to your online forms to track submissions.” 
Reddit

Learning curve / configuration friction

“Took a little while to get everything configured … making changes later can be really time consuming and fiddly.” 
Reddit

🚀 How TradesMatePro Can Do Better (Fixes & Features to Build)

Using those pain points, here are concrete features and policies you should build in now:

Problem	Proposed Fix / Feature	Why It Matters
Pushy sales / forced upgrades	Free core — no pressure sales. Let users upgrade when they want.	Builds trust. Users won’t feel trapped.
Mobile bugs / unreliability	Build robust, cross-platform mobile-first UI. Add fallback caching/resync logic.	Techs in the field need reliable tools.
Locked data access after cancel	Always allow users to export their data (invoices, jobs) even after they cancel.	Prevents “hostage data” complaints.
Weak integrations / poor API	Build a strong, flexible API from day one. Deep Zapier-like hooks (webhooks, full object sync)	Users want to connect to CRMs, ad platforms, analytics.
One-way calendar sync	Bi-directional calendar sync (Jobber → Google, Google → Jobber)	Users schedule outside your app; must stay in sync.
No marketing tracking	Let users add tracking pixels (Google, Meta) on quote request forms	Helps them measure marketing ROI.
Friction in setup	Onboarding wizard that guides you through core setup (services, pricing, team)	Reduces drop-off and support burden.
📌 Which of These Would Be Highest Impact for You to Build Now?

Export / data access — because once someone cancels, if they can’t get their data, that’s a red flag and terrible for reputation.

Strong API + webhooks — allows integrations now and downstream.

Bi-directional calendar sync — solves a daily chore problem for contractors.

Onboarding wizard + setup guidance — reduce “getting started pain.”

Allow marketing/tracking embed — helps contractors scale their business using your tool.

If you like, I can pull 10 more threads complaining about Jobber, Housecall, etc., and distill the 20 biggest pain points. Then we can carve a competitive features map for TradesMatePro so you start ahead, not playing catch-up. Do you want me to do that?

i actually agree with the locked data access after cancel. downloading using supabase isn't free. id say if thye unsubscribe pop up a wanting that they will lose access to db becasue of cost? 
ChatGPT said:

That’s a smart, honest approach 👍 — and exactly where a lot of Jobber’s backlash comes from.

Here’s how you can design it fair + cost-aware without falling into the “data hostage” trap:

🔹 Industry Problem

Jobber, ServiceTitan, etc. lock people out completely after cancellation → forcing re-subscription to see old invoices.

Users call this “holding data hostage.”

For you, Supabase does charge for storage + egress, so keeping unlimited access forever isn’t free.

🔹 Better Solution (Transparency + Options)

When a user clicks “Cancel Subscription”:

Popup warning (clear + transparent)

“After cancellation, your live access to TradesMatePro ends.

Your data is not lost, but exporting is only available until [date] unless you download it now.”

“Supabase charges us for storage, so we cannot keep your account active for free.”

Offer immediate export

One-click export: JSON, CSV, or PDF bundle (Quotes, Invoices, Jobs, Customers).

“Download all my data now” → zip archive.

Grace period

Keep the account in “read-only mode” for 14–30 days.

After that, charge a small “data vault” plan (e.g., $5/month) to keep history online.

Final deletion or archive

If they don’t pay for storage, after 30 days, their DB rows are soft-archived to cold storage (cheap object storage, not Supabase DB).

You can offer reactivation later (charge a recovery fee).

🔹 How You Win vs Competitors

Not free forever (you’re transparent that storage costs money).

Not locked forever (they don’t need to pay a full subscription just to download invoices).

Small contractors see you as fair, not greedy.

🔹 Example Flow (Better UX)

User cancels → modal pops up:

“You’re about to cancel. You’ll lose access to the app, but you can still download your invoices and jobs.
Keep access for 30 days free. After that, either download or pay $5/mo for storage.”

Buttons:

✅ Download all my data (zip)

🔒 Keep my account in read-only mode ($5/mo after 30 days)

❌ Delete my data permanently

Would you like me to draft the SQL + Supabase storage flow so Claude can implement a “one-click export” (customers, quotes, jobs, invoices) and tie it into that cancellation popup? That way you have the whole export + grace period + archive system ready.

You said:
whats marketing tracking iwht tags and such that guy was talking about?
ChatGPT said:

Great catch 👌 — that Reddit complaint about Jobber’s lack of marketing tracking is really important, especially for contractors who advertise online. Let me break it down:

🔹 What “Marketing Tracking with Tags/Pixels” Means

When a potential customer fills out a quote request form (or books a job), the business wants to know:

Where did that lead come from? (Google Ads? Facebook? Website?)

Did my ad spend actually convert into a paying customer?

The way this is tracked is by adding pixels / tags to forms and pages:

Google Ads Tag / Conversion Tracking

Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Pixel

LinkedIn Insight Tag

UTM parameters (Google Analytics → track traffic sources with URLs like ?utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=winterpromo)

🔹 What Competitors Get Wrong

From the Reddit post:

Jobber doesn’t let you add these tags to their hosted forms.

Contractors can’t track whether ads are driving actual leads → money wasted.

Their “integrations” (Zapier, etc.) only pass very limited data (just a contact, not the conversion context).

🔹 How You Can Fix This in TradesMatePro

Allow Marketing Pixel Injection

In Company Settings → Marketing & Analytics, let users paste their tracking snippets:

Google Ads Conversion Tag

Meta Pixel

LinkedIn Tag

These automatically load on customer-facing forms (quote requests, booking pages, customer portal).

Capture UTM Parameters

Whenever a lead fills out a form, capture the URL parameters (utm_source, utm_campaign, utm_medium).

Store them in the DB alongside the lead. Example:

ALTER TABLE marketplace_requests
  ADD COLUMN utm_source TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN utm_campaign TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN utm_medium TEXT;


Lead Attribution Dashboard

Show reports like:

“Leads by Source” (Google Ads 45%, Facebook 30%, Organic 25%)

“Conversion Rate by Campaign”

“Revenue by Source” (connect accepted quotes → invoices → payments back to the source).

🔹 Industry Standard vs. Better Approach

Jobber/ServiceTitan: No deep ad tracking. Only “did you get a lead, yes/no.”

TradesMatePro (your app):

Track source → quote → work order → invoice → payment.

Let users prove ROI on ads (“I spent $500 on Google, got $4,200 in paid jobs”).

Exportable reports for accountants/marketers.

⚡ Bottom line:
Marketing tracking = pixels + UTM capture + reporting.
Contractors desperately want this because ads cost them real money, and current tools don’t connect the dots.

👉 Do you want me to draft the DB schema updates + frontend hooks for pixel injection and UTM tracking so Claude can wire it up without guessing?

so reddit seems to be the place to find issues with hosuecall servicetitan and jobber. any other reddit posts we should use to make a master fix list from? 
ChatGPT said:

Yes — Reddit is a great source for real user grievances. I poked around, and found more threads with complaints and observations about Jobber, HouseCall Pro, ServiceTitan, etc. We can absolutely harvest those into a “master fix list” of things TradesmatePro should avoid or fix proactively. Below, I summarize useful posts + recurring themes / pain points, and then propose how to build that list for continuous improvement.

🔍 Sample Reddit Findings & Pain Points

Here are a few Reddit threads I found, with quotes and what they highlight:

“What CRM are most of your HVAC companies using?” →

“Service Titan has all the features but a massive price tag whereas Housecall pro has like 70% of features but half the cost.” 
Reddit

Takeaway: Feature-rich at a premium is a common complaint; users expect solid features even at lower tiers.

“What’s your biggest problem with Service Titan?” →

“It takes forever to train up any of my new employees.” 
Reddit

Takeaway: Training complexity and onboarding friction is a big pain.

“Not happy with Jobber. Beware.” →
The thread complains about pricing, hidden costs, features locked behind tiers. 
Reddit

“Why shouldn’t I use Jobber?” →

“Main issues are its expensive and the tier system is wonky … for a solo like me it's hard to cough up $100 USD / mo and not have basic features.” 
Reddit

Also: “ios won’t allow you to view a whole month of scheduled jobs … no option to delete it once added.” 
Reddit

Takeaways:

Pricing / tier inflexibility

Mobile app feature gaps

Inability to delete or fully manage calendar entries

“Is anyone using Housecall Pro? Is it worth it?” →

“We use it … occasionally some glitches … billing stuff like dates get messed up.” 
Reddit

Takeaway: Edge‐case bugs in billing/date logic surface and degrade trust.

“Anyone use Housecall Pro?” →

“Very user friendly from both an office and field standpoint. Integrates easily with QuickBooks too.” 
Reddit

Takeaway: Positive feedback often centers around ease of use and integration — so that’s a baseline expectation.

“ServiceTitan, Jobber or Planado?” →

“Service Titan is the best hands down but it will come with a price tag like $500 per tech per month so you better have some money makers.” 
Reddit

Takeaway: Cost scaling is a major issue; the “per tech” pricing model hurts smaller firms.

“Best Software & prices for new HVAC company & 6 techs” →

“I use Housecall Pro now and it’s $180 a month I think … ServiceTitan is better.” 
Reddit

Takeaway: Even mid-size firms find pricing burdensome, and comparisons are common.

Feature trade-offs (users pay but core features missing)	Don’t over-gate features that users expect as baseline	Prioritize core features for everyone; advanced as optional
✅ What Next: Building a “Continuous Reddit Listening” Pipeline

To keep this fix list fresh and ongoing:

Bookmark relevant subreddits: r/Construction, r/HVAC, r/Contractors, r/FieldService, r/sweatystartup

Monthly scan: Search posts with keywords like “Jobber issues”, “ServiceTitan bug”, “Housecall Pro complaint”.

Tag & categorize: Log each complaint under categories (pricing, mobile, integration, data access, etc.).

Prioritize fixes: Use frequency + impact to pick which to fix first.

🔍 Master Feedback & Complaints from Real Users (Reddit)

Here are key pain points, quotes, and what you can learn:

Category	Complaint / Feedback	Quote / Source	What to Do in TradesmatePro
Pricing & Tiering	Too expensive for small operators; essential features locked behind tiers	“It’s expensive and the tier system is wonky … for a solo like me it’s hard to cough up $100 USD / mo and not have basic features like automatic invoice follow ups.” 
Reddit
	Make the baseline robust. Don’t gate core features that contractors expect.
Cancel / Data Access	Hard to cancel, losing access to data after unsubscribing	“They make it for someone to cancel their subscription … after cancellation … lose access to invoices.” 
Reddit
	Offer export/read-only grace period. Allow users to download their data before lockout.
Onboarding / Setup Complexity	Time-consuming setup and manual data import	“Very setup heavy … even import/export of historical invoices … took hours to configure … no migration team.” 
Reddit
	Build an onboarding wizard + migration/import tools. Smooth “get started” experience is critical.
Performance / Slowness	App gets slow after hours of use; performance degrades	“After about 5 hours, Service Titan slows down to an unbelievable crawl …” 
Reddit
	Monitor performance. Optimize queries, caching, pagination. Ensure the app scales well.
Mobile / Field Bugs	Billing-date logic messed up; app glitches	“Billing stuff like dates get messed up.” 
Reddit
	For mobile apps, test edge cases (time zones, daylight savings, date validation).
Labor / Idle Time Calculations	App counts “idle time” incorrectly, underreports hours	“ServiceTitan reads a lot of ‘idle time’ … I worked … and then idle time cut hours.” 
Reddit
	Be transparent in timesheet logic. Allow manual adjustments.
Cost vs Value	Many feel software costs too much relative to what is delivered	“Servicetitan is fantastic but cost prohibitive on a small shop.” 
Reddit
	Price transparently. Provide tiers or modular model so small shops can afford.
Support & Customization	Support shallow, permissions reset on updates	“They reset permissions after every major update … support doesn’t go deep.” 
Reddit
	Make settings stable (don’t wipe user settings on upgrades). Offer deep documentation / advanced support.
Integration / Accounting Limitations	Incomplete or superficial integrations, poor profit/expense tracking	“Jobber only shows revenue … no way for expenses, assets, liabilities.” 
Reddit
	Your finance module must allow expense tracking + integrate well with accounting tools.
Feature Gaps	Missing functions / lack of flexibility	“Housecall pro is much more polish … lacks customizing where is needed.” 
Reddit
	Design modular features so users can extend/customize workflows.
User Experience (Office / Field)	Mixed praise: easy for field, harder for office	“We use it … very user friendly from both office and field … integrates easily with QuickBooks.” 
Reddit
	Maintain intuitive UI for both field and office users.
Tier / Scale Mismatch	Big companies forced into expensive tiers; small shops feel squeezed	“Service Titan is only attainable for big companies … would eat your profit fast.” 
Reddit
	Scale pricing and features gracefully. Let users grow without immediate cost shock.
Permissions / Role-based Config	Complexity in access control, permissions reset	From ServiceTitan feedback threads: permissions get reset after updates. 
Reddit
+1
	Make role/permission management stable and version-independent.
Export / Backup / Data Portability	Lack of ability to export all data easily	Implied in cancellation / migration complaints. 
Reddit
+1
	Provide robust export (CSV/JSON/backup) for all major entities.
Complexity for Growth	Complexity increases as business scales (teams, multiple locations)	Many mention ServiceTitan is good for large scale but too much for small shops.

	Use modular / plug-in features. Keep the core clean and lean.

    📋 Feature Breakdown
1. Online Booking

What competitors do: Customer-facing booking portal where a homeowner can select a time slot directly from your availability.

Industry standard: Jobber, Housecall, ServiceTitan all push this as a lead generator.

Do you need it?

Yes, at least a basic booking request form that plugs into the unified pipeline (auto-creates a “quote request” in DB).

Doesn’t need to be a live calendar picker yet; even a request form with preferred time slots is enough for v1.

2. Review Management

What competitors do: Send review requests after job completion, often linked to Google Reviews / Yelp / FB.

Industry standard: Yes, customers expect “leave us a review” workflows.

Do you need it?

Basic: Yes → email/SMS prompt with a link to your Google Business Profile.

Premium: No (competitors upsell “review aggregation dashboards,” you don’t need to gate that, can just keep it simple).

3. Postcards & Email Marketing

What competitors do: Bulk mailing campaigns, seasonal promotions, “we miss you” emails.

Industry standard: Only for larger SMBs; most small guys never touch this.

Do you need it?

Optional. Could be an add-on powered by Mailchimp/Sendgrid integration.

Not core.

For your model: keep marketing basics free (send reminder emails), upsell advanced campaigns.

4. Customer Equipment Tracking

What competitors do: Track model/serial numbers of equipment at customer sites (e.g., HVAC units, water heaters).

Industry standard: Big one for HVAC, plumbing, electrical. ServiceTitan leans hard on this.

Do you need it?

Yes, but lightweight → a table tied to customers: customer_assets with make, model, serial, install date, service notes.

This gives you a big differentiator because Jobber’s version is limited and Titan’s is locked in higher tiers.

5. Premium Review Mgmt

What competitors do: Aggregate reviews from Google/Yelp/Angi into one dashboard with analytics.

Industry standard: Not really needed for most SMBs; mostly fluff.

Do you need it?

Probably skip this for now. Better to nail basic review requests first.

6. Checklists

What competitors do: Job task checklists for technicians → “Before leaving site: ✓ Photos, ✓ Clean up, ✓ Verify equipment.”

Industry standard: Yes, field checklists are common.

Do you need it?

✅ You already have Proofio. This could become your killer feature if you integrate:

Proofio templates = Job templates

Proofio smart parsing = Custom workflows

Offline checklists = Field-proof, even if internet is down

Competitors gate this behind higher tiers → you’d make it free or a light add-on.

7. Sales Proposal Tool

What competitors do: Fancy PDF/HTML proposals with pictures, options (Good/Better/Best), e-signature.

Industry standard: More advanced than basic quotes, but common in remodels/roofing.

Do you need it?

Not core.

Could be an add-on later, possibly re-using your quote → PDF → send for e-signature flow.

✅ Recommendation

Here’s how I’d position TradesmatePro with Proofio included:

Core (everyone gets):

Online booking request (basic form → creates quote)

Basic review requests (Google review links)

Customer equipment tracking (lightweight assets table)

Proofio-powered checklists (templates + offline mode!)

Add-ons (a la carte):

Marketing campaigns (Mailchimp/Sendgrid)

Premium review mgmt (multi-platform aggregation)

Sales proposal builder (advanced PDF w/ e-signatures)

👉 If you integrate Proofio as the Tradesmate Checklists module, you’d be ahead of Jobber/Housecall immediately — because theirs are barebones, and you already have smart parsing + offline logic.

Do you want me to sketch how Proofio DB tables could connect into your existing unified pipeline (quotes → work orders → invoices), so it’s a clean add-on instead of a bolt-on?
