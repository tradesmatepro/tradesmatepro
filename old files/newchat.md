hello, claude. youre helping me with my app. its like jobber, housecall, servicetitan but its suppsoed to be better and cheaper. we want to take care of customer complaints that people have with those other apps and improve on it in our. also we want a marketplace built in kind of like angi or thumbtack. in the root you built a how to use devtools and deploy note for yourself.  and in here D:\TradeMate Pro Webapp\APP Schemas\Locked theres kind of a project map and tradesmate_project_info.md that you will need. now the map and locked schema was what we thought was standard but apparently its not caues youve editied the ideas several time so youll need to check supabase for tables and columns and enums and contraints instead of the paperwork in the folder. also we want to stay as standard as possible with the app so when i talk about the app and we make edits we want to match jobber, housecall, servicetitan as much as possible only exceptions is to make it better. like instead of quotes tables and job tables and invoices tables we instead of a work_orders table taht changes states based on status like quote, infvoiced, etcetera. this unified pipeline is better. instead of a bunch of trigger to do things like calculations we want that to be built into the front end and maybe triggers on the backedn only to verify. this is better doing triggers all on backend was more of a legacy app thing from years ago. enums should all be lowercase no mix and match causing confusion. and another thing. we are in beta. so not really worried about security and rls at this point. please get familiar with the app and let me know when you are ready.
