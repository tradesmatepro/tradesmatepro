## 🚀 NEW STATUSES ADDED

### **1. 'presented' (From ServiceTitan)**
**Use Case:** In-person quotes shown to customer
- Tracks when quote was physically presented (not just emailed)
- Important for field service businesses
- Helps distinguish between "sent via email" vs "shown in person"

**Example:**
- Technician goes to customer's house
- Shows quote on tablet/paper
- Marks as "Presented"
- Better tracking than just "Sent"

---

### **2. 'changes_requested' (From Jobber)**
**Use Case:** Customer wants modifications before approving
- Very common in real-world scenarios
- Customer says "I like it, but can you change X?"
- Prevents confusion between "rejected" and "needs revision"

**Example:**
- Customer: "I want the premium package, but can you remove the warranty?"
- Status: "Changes Requested"
- Revise quote → Send again
- Much clearer than marking as "Draft" or "Rejected"

---

### **3. 'follow_up' (From ServiceTitan)**
**Use Case:** Quote needs follow-up call/visit
- Built-in sales tracking
- Prevents quotes from falling through cracks
- Helps sales process

**Example:**
- Quote sent 3 days ago, no response
- Mark as "Follow-up Needed"
- Sales team knows to call customer
- Better than just "Sent" status

---

### **4. 'expired' (From Housecall Pro)**
**Use Case:** Quote expired (time-based)
- Automatic cleanup of old quotes
- Prevents confusion about old pricing
- Industry standard: quotes expire after 30 days

**Example:**
- Quote sent 45 days ago
- Pricing may have changed
- Auto-mark as "Expired"
- Customer can request new quote with current pricing
