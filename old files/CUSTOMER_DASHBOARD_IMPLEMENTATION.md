# Customer Dashboard Implementation - Beta Ready

## üéØ **Overview**

Successfully implemented a comprehensive **Customer Dashboard** for TradeMate Pro that provides contractors with a unified view of all customer relationships, quotes, jobs, invoices, leads, and communications. This is separate from the existing Customer Portal (which is for customers) and integrates seamlessly into the Sales section of the main contractor app.

## üìã **What Was Built**

### **1. Database Schema (NEW TABLES)**
- **`customer_messages`** - Customer ‚Üî Contractor communication (separate from internal messages)
- **`service_requests`** - Marketplace-style leads with nullable company_id for multi-tenant marketplace
- **`customer_signatures`** - E-signature capture for quotes and approvals
- **Proper indexes, triggers, and RLS-ready policies**

### **2. Customer Dashboard Page**
- **Location:** `/customer-dashboard` (Sales section)
- **Tabbed interface:** Overview, Quotes, Jobs, Invoices, Leads, Messages
- **Real-time data loading** from unified work_orders table
- **Responsive design** with mobile-first approach

### **3. Dashboard Components**

#### **CustomerOverview.js**
- Key metrics dashboard with trends
- Action items (open leads, unread messages)
- Recent activity feed from all customer interactions
- Quick actions for common tasks

#### **CustomerQuotes.js**
- View quotes from `work_orders` where `stage = 'QUOTE'`
- Accept/Decline quote actions
- Detailed quote viewer with financial breakdown
- Status tracking and expiration dates

#### **CustomerJobs.js**
- Track jobs from `work_orders` where `stage = 'JOB'` or `'WORK_ORDER'`
- Progress tracking and timeline view
- Service address and scheduling information
- Completion status and notes

#### **CustomerInvoices.js**
- Invoice management with payment status
- Overdue invoice highlighting
- Manual "Mark as Paid" functionality
- PDF download preparation (placeholder)

#### **CustomerLeads.js** (Replaces Incoming Requests)
- **Marketplace functionality:** Unassigned leads (company_id = null)
- **Accept/Decline workflow:** Sets company_id when accepted
- **Emergency request highlighting**
- **Filter by status:** Open, Accepted, Emergency
- **Customer information display**

#### **CustomerMessages.js**
- **Segregated messaging:** Customer ‚Üî Contractor only (not internal)
- **Work order context:** Messages can be tied to specific jobs
- **Real-time conversation view**
- **Read/unread status tracking**
- **Customer list with unread counts**

### **4. Navigation Updates**
- **Added to Sales section:** Customer Dashboard as first item
- **Moved Leads:** Service Requests moved from Operations to Sales
- **Legacy support:** Old `/incoming-requests` route still works

### **5. Architecture Highlights**

#### **Multi-Tenant Marketplace Design**
```sql
-- Service requests start unassigned (marketplace)
service_requests.company_id = NULL  -- Available to all contractors

-- Once accepted, becomes private
service_requests.company_id = contractor_company_id  -- Only that company sees it
```

#### **Unified Work Orders Pipeline**
- Uses existing `work_orders` table with `stage` field
- No separate quotes/jobs tables (follows your superior architecture)
- Automatic stage transitions via database triggers

#### **Message Segregation**
- **Internal messages:** `messages` table (contractors/employees only)
- **Customer messages:** `customer_messages` table (customer ‚Üî contractor only)
- **Never mixed:** Prevents customer spam to internal teams

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema Details**

### **customer_messages**
```sql
- id (uuid, PK)
- company_id (uuid, FK to companies) -- RLS isolation
- customer_id (uuid, FK to customers)
- work_order_id (uuid, FK to work_orders, nullable)
- sender_type ('customer' | 'contractor')
- sender_id (uuid) -- customer_id or user_id
- message_text (text)
- attachments (jsonb)
- read_at (timestamptz, nullable)
- created_at, updated_at (timestamptz)
```

### **service_requests**
```sql
- id (uuid, PK)
- customer_id (uuid, FK to customers)
- company_id (uuid, FK to companies, NULLABLE) -- Marketplace key
- service_type, title, description (text)
- service_location (text)
- preferred_date (timestamptz, nullable)
- emergency (boolean, default false)
- budget_range (text, nullable)
- status ('open' | 'accepted' | 'declined' | 'completed' | 'cancelled')
- accepted_at, accepted_by (timestamptz, uuid, nullable)
- work_order_id (uuid, FK to work_orders, nullable)
- created_at, updated_at (timestamptz)
```

### **customer_signatures**
```sql
- id (uuid, PK)
- work_order_id (uuid, FK to work_orders)
- customer_id (uuid, FK to customers)
- signature_type ('quote_approval' | 'work_completion' | 'invoice_approval')
- signed_by (text) -- Customer name
- signature_data (text) -- Base64 signature image
- ip_address (text, nullable)
- signed_at, created_at (timestamptz)
```

## üöÄ **Installation Steps**

### **1. Run Database Migration**
```bash
# Execute the SQL file in Supabase dashboard or via psql
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f "sql files/customer_dashboard_schema.sql"
```

### **2. Verify Routes**
- `/customer-dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/leads` - Service request leads (moved from `/incoming-requests`)

### **3. Test Navigation**
- Sales section should show "Customer Dashboard" as first item
- "Leads (Service Requests)" should appear in Sales section
- Old "Incoming Requests" removed from Operations
