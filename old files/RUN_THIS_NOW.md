## ✅ Success Looks Like:

**Console:**
```
✅ Using rate_cards table (industry standard)
💰 Final calculated rates: {hourly: 75, overtime: 112.5, emergency: 150}
```

**No Errors:**
- ❌ No "service_rates not found in schema cache"
- ❌ No "pricing_rules not found in schema cache"

---

## 🎯 What This Fixed:

- ✅ Frontend now uses `rate_cards` table (exists in your locked schema)
- ✅ Industry standard like Jobber/ServiceTitan
- ✅ Better than Jobber (has multipliers and effective dates)
- ✅ No more 404 errors
