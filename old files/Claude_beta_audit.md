### üî¥ **CRITICAL ISSUES - MUST FIX FOR BETA**

#### **1. Integration System - Placeholder Only**
- **Issue:** All integrations (QuickBooks, SMS, Google Calendar) are placeholder implementations
- **Impact:** Users will expect working integrations based on UI promises
- **Files:** `src/services/IntegrationsService.js`, `src/components/IntegrationsUI.js`
- **Fix Required:** Either implement basic integrations OR clearly mark as "Coming Soon"

#### **2. Hardcoded Fallback Data**
- **Issue:** Multiple services have hardcoded fallback data that masks database issues
- **Files:** 
  - `src/services/SettingsService.js` (lines 56-83)
  - `src/components/PTO/PTOBalanceDashboard.js` (lines 78-86)
- **Fix Required:** Remove fallbacks, ensure proper error handling

#### **3. Environment Configuration**
- **Issue:** Hardcoded Supabase credentials in multiple files
- **Files:** `src/services/DatabaseSetupService.js` (lines 6-10), `supabasecreds.txt`
- **Fix Required:** Proper environment variable configuration

#### **4. Feature Flag Inconsistencies**
- **Issue:** Some features show in UI but are disabled by feature flags
- **Files:** `src/utils/features.js`, `src/App.js` (line 128)
- **Fix Required:** Align UI visibility with feature flag states

---

### ‚ùå **MISSING ENTIRELY**

#### **Coming Soon Features (Properly Handled)**
