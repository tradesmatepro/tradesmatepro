Plan and scope
You asked for a targeted audit (no random refactors) across three flows, plus feature flags and unit tests. Below is a concise, actionable checklist with exact files, functions, and line ranges to touch, followed by minimal diffs that focus on state loops, stale selectors, table-vs-view use, and null guards. I’ve also included small unit tests and feature-flag gates for Messaging and Integrations.

If you want me to apply any subset of these changes, tell me which items and I’ll implement them.

1) Work order lifecycle: Quote → Job → Work Order → Completed
Files to touch and why
src/pages/WorkOrders.js
handleStatusChange: enforce allowed transitions (prevent invalid hops)
loadWorkOrders: use consistent views (work_orders_v) for invoices, not the base table
filteredWorkOrders: ensure robust status selection from stage fields with null guards
src/utils/workOrderStatus.js
(Reference) STATUS_TRANSITIONS and isStatusTransitionAllowed used to validate transitions
Findings
Potential misuse of views vs table for the invoice list: invoices branch currently queries work_orders (table) instead of work_orders_v (view) used elsewhere; this risks stale projections and column differences.
Status transitions aren’t validated; a user could jump from QUOTE → COMPLETED directly.
Minor null-guard risks when a record lacks stage-specific fields.
Minimal diffs
Enforce legal transitions in handleStatusChange using isStatusTransitionAllowed

WorkOrders.js
src/pages

WorkOrders.js
src/pages
Use the view for invoices (consistent with other branches) and add a null-safe fallback

WorkOrders.js

WorkOrders.js

Add null guards when deriving currentStatus for robustness

2) Scheduling: multi-tech, PTO overlap prevention, reschedule rollback
Files to touch and why
src/utils/smartScheduling.js
getEmployeeSchedule: merge PTO as blocking events
src/pages/Calendar.js
handleEventDrop/handleEventResize: persist changes to backend, detect conflicts (incl. PTO), and revert UI on failure
src/services/PTOService.js
(Reference) checkPTOConflict / getEmployeePTO available, but not yet used by scheduling
Findings
PTO is not currently blocking availability in suggestions; we should merge employee_time_off into the existing event list as blocking.
Calendar drag/resize only mutates local state; no backend update, no overlap/PTO validation, no revert. This causes “silent” conflicts.
Minimal diffs
Merge PTO into conflict sources

smartScheduling.js
src/utils
Add backend persist + rollback for reschedule

Calendar.js
src/pages

Calendar.js
src/pages
Same pattern for handleEventResize: call persist, else revert.

3) Invoicing MVP: create from completed work order, numbering, PDF, status changes
Files to touch and why
src/services/InvoicesService.js
Use total_amount (consistent with work order schema) or compute from items; provide helper for totals
Optional: stub PDF via HTML print-out (no paid deps), status updates
Findings
total_amount source is inconsistent: using job.total_cost which likely isn’t present on work_orders; use job.total_amount or compute.
Add a pure helper to compute totals (subtotal, tax, total) from items; unit-testable.
Minimal diffs
Fix total source and expose a compute function

InvoicesService.js
src/services

InvoicesService.js
src/services
Add a minimal pure helper (kept internal or exported) to compute totals from items

InvoicesService.js
src/services
PDF: for MVP, render a print-ready HTML and instruct the user to print-to-PDF from the browser (no new deps). If you want, I can add a “Print Invoice” route rendering invoice HTML.
4) Unit tests (vitest/jest) — minimal, pure and fast
I propose adding three test files. If you prefer Jest vs Vitest, I’ll align to your config; these are plain ESM.

tests for conflict detection

smartScheduling.conflict.test.js
src/__tests__
tests for reschedule logic (pure helper in test to simulate persist + revert decision)

calendar.reschedule.test.js
src/__tests__
tests for invoice totals

invoices.totals.test.js
src/__tests__
Note: If tests live under a different root in your setup, I’ll adjust paths.

5) Feature flags: gate Messaging + Integrations
Files to add/touch and why
src/utils/features.js: central flags from env
src/pages/Messages.js, src/components/IntegrationsUI.js, src/components/IntegrationDrawer.js: early-return if disabled
Minimal diffs
Add feature flags helper

features.js
src/utils
Gate Messaging

Messages.js
src/pages
Gate Integrations UI

IntegrationsUI.js
src/components
Gate Integration Drawer

IntegrationDrawer.js
src/components
Set via env (no paid services):

REACT_APP_FEATURE_MESSAGING=false
REACT_APP_FEATURE_INTEGRATIONS=false
Quick checklist summary
Work order lifecycle
Validate status transitions (WorkOrders.handleStatusChange)
Use work_orders_v for invoices branch
Add null guards for status selection
Scheduling
Merge PTO as blocking events in getEmployeeSchedule
Calendar reschedule: persist to backend, detect conflicts, revert UI on failure
Keep multi-tech filtering as implemented
Invoicing
Use job.total_amount (or compute from items) in createInvoiceFromJob
Add computeInvoiceTotals helper
Optional: print-to-PDF via browser for MVP
Unit tests
conflict detection
reschedule decision
invoice totals
Feature flags
Add src/utils/features.js
Gate Messages and Integrations components
Next steps
Tell me which items you want applied first. I recommend:
PTO blocking + reschedule rollback
Lifecycle guards + views alignment
Invoice totals helper + tests
Feature flags gating
I can implement them in small PR-sized chunks and run tests if your project has Jest/Vitest configured.
