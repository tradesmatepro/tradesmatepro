7. **Seed Data**: Confirm default data inserted

### **🧪 Test Queries:**
```sql
-- Verify core tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check enum types
SELECT typname FROM pg_type WHERE typtype = 'e' ORDER BY typname;

-- Verify seed data
SELECT * FROM billing_plans;
SELECT * FROM service_categories;
SELECT * FROM permissions;

-- Test business views
SELECT * FROM work_orders_summary LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM customers_summary LIMIT 5;
```
