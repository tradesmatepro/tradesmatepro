- ✅ Auto-set quote expiration (30 days)
- ✅ Auto-track analytics

### **5. Created Quote Defaults System** ✅

## 📚 TERMINOLOGY CLARIFICATION

### **Quote vs Estimate vs Bid**

**QUOTE** ✅ (What we use):
- Binding price - Customer accepts, price is locked
- Detailed breakdown - Line items, labor, materials
- Professional - Industry standard
- Used by: ServiceTitan, Jobber, Housecall Pro

**ESTIMATE** ⚠️ (Informal):
- Non-binding - "Ballpark figure", can change
- Less detailed - Rough numbers
- Unprofessional - Customers don't trust it
- **All quotes ARE estimates until accepted**

**BID** ⚠️ (Competitive):
- For large projects - Multiple contractors bidding
- Formal process - RFP, sealed bids
- Commercial/government - Not typical field service
- **Not a pricing model**

### **4. PERCENTAGE** (Subcontractors)

- **When**: Subcontractor work, referral fees
