🏢 Phase 2 – Enterprise Views & Materialized Views (Revised & Merged)

This revision combines GPT’s solid foundations (SLA, workforce, job costing, KPI dashboards) with Claude’s enhancements (predictive SLA, workforce intelligence, real-time profitability, budget variance, advanced KPIs).

The result = ServiceTitan-level analytics + predictive intelligence beyond competitors.

🕒 SLA & Service Agreement Intelligence
Active & Predictive SLA Tracking
-- Active SLA status
CREATE VIEW active_sla_view AS
SELECT sa.id AS sla_id,
       sa.company_id,
       c.full_name AS customer_name,
       w.work_order_number,
       sa.response_time_hours,
       EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - w.created_at))/3600 AS hours_elapsed,
       CASE 
         WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - w.created_at))/3600 > sa.response_time_hours 
         THEN 'violation' ELSE 'compliant' END AS sla_status
FROM service_agreements sa
JOIN work_orders w ON sa.work_order_id = w.id
JOIN customers c ON w.customer_id = c.id
WHERE sa.status = 'active';

-- Predictive SLA intelligence
CREATE VIEW predictive_sla_intelligence AS

       CASE 
         WHEN w.actual_start IS NULL AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - w.created_at))/3600 > sa.response_time_hours * 0.8 
              THEN 'response_risk'
         WHEN w.completion_date IS NULL AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - w.created_at))/3600 > sa.resolution_time_hours * 0.8 
              THEN 'resolution_risk'
         ELSE 'compliant'
       END AS sla_status
FROM service_agreements sa

SLA Penalty Analysis
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sla_penalty_mv AS

         WHEN ec.expiry_date < CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'expiring_soon'
         ELSE 'valid'
       END AS compliance_status
FROM employees e
JOIN employee_certifications ec ON e.id = ec.employee_id
WHERE e.employment_status = 'active';

Workforce Optimization & Performance
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_performance_mv AS
SELECT pr.employee_id,
       e.full_name,
       AVG(pr.overall_rating) AS avg_rating,
       COUNT(pr.id) AS review_count,
