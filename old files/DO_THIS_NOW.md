# âš¡ DO THIS NOW - 5 Minute Fix

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem

Supabase PostgREST schema cache is out of sync. Tables exist but PostgREST doesn't know about them.

---

## âœ… The Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Go to Supabase SQL Editor (1 min)
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cxlqzejzraczumqmsrcx/sql

### Step 2: Run This Command (10 seconds)
```sql
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

### Step 3: Wait 30 Seconds
PostgREST needs time to reload the schema cache.

## ðŸ§ª Test It Worked

1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
2. Go to Quotes page
3. Open console (F12)
4. Look for:
   - âœ… No more "not found in schema cache" errors
   - âœ… service_rates returns 200 (not 404)
   - âœ… pricing_rules returns 200 (not 404)

---

## ðŸ”„ If That Didn't Work

Run this to verify tables exist:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN ('service_rates', 'pricing_rules', 'rate_cards')
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**If you see 3 rows:** Tables exist, try reloading schema again or restart Supabase project

**If you see 0 rows:** Tables don't exist, need to create them (see THE_REAL_FIX.md)
