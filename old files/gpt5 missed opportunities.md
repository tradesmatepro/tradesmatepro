1. Daily Logs & Issue Tracking on the Job Site

Market gap: Many platforms lack real-time field reporting features.
Research: Modern apps like Raken and Fieldwire offer voice-to-text daily logs, photo uploads, safety checklists, and RFI tagging with push notifications—features tradesmen love. 
PermitFlow

Opportunity: Add geotagged photo uploads, quick voice logs, offline checklists, and issue tagging tied to jobs. This will give basefield teams an easier way to document and stay compliant.

2. Smart Scheduling with Conflict Detection & Routing

Gap in field service apps: Common issues include double-bookings, overlapping schedules, and inefficient routing. 
NetSuite

Opportunity: Build in smart scheduling that avoids overlaps, matches technicians’ skills to jobs, optimizes routes, and flags conflicts proactively.

3. Skill-Based Dispatch & Team Matching

Need identified: Scheduling the wrong technician for a job is expensive and frustrating. 
Dataforma

Opportunity: Let admins tag team members with specific skills/certifications and have the system recommend or auto-assign happy matches.

4. Customer & Subcontractor Portals

Standout apps (e.g., Buildertrend): Offer client/sub portals to streamline communication. 
Buildertrend

Opportunity: Give customers the ability to view status, quotes, upload attachments, and approve jobs. Let subs receive tasks, upload photos, or clock time via a portal—cutting out back-and-forth emails or calls.

5. Financial Within Projects, Not Just Documents

Shortfalls noted: Tools often disconnect financials from core projects. 
Buildertrend

Opportunity: Enable:

Invoicing directly from job pages.

Job budgets that auto-adjust as expenses, quotes, or POs are added.

Real-time cash flow insights per job.

6. SKU-Level Inventory & Takeoff Estimating

Missing tools: Non-technical apps lack estimating/calculator tools (like takeoffs, markup calculators). 
PermitFlow

Opportunity: Embed:

On-screen area takeoffs (paint/sqft, roofing).

Catalog pricing with live markup rates.

Line-item SKU tracking and alerts for low stock.

7. Integrated Payments, Customer Experience Controls

Industry shift: Integrated payments are becoming table stakes—gone are the days of separate billing systems. 
Service Fusion

Opportunity: Add:

Multiple payment support (card, ACH, partial payments).

Self-service portals so customers pay at their convenience.

Auto reminders and invoice aging alerts in-app.

Why This Matters

You already have a robust backbone (Dashboard, Jobs, Quotes, Tools, etc.). Now's the chance to surpass competitors not because of more modules, but because your modules are deeper, smarter, and tailored to real pain points.
