🏢 How Big Names Handle Marketing

In-House Teams

Companies like ServiceTitan, Jobber, Salesforce have dedicated marketing teams that run campaigns for themselves and build marketing modules into the product.

Example: ServiceTitan’s “Marketing Pro” is its own add-on, charging customers extra for features like campaigns and reputation management.

Partnerships with Email/SMS Tools

Many platforms don’t build everything from scratch. They integrate with HubSpot, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, ActiveCampaign for email campaigns.

SMS is usually powered by Twilio under the hood. They rebrand it and upsell it.

Reputation & Review Platforms

“Leave a review” flows are monetized via partnerships with Google Reviews, Yelp, Angi, HomeAdvisor.

Marketing dashboards often include review request automation (text/email asking customer for a 5-star review).

Lead Marketplaces & Ads

They integrate or funnel customers into paid leads (Angi’s List, Thumbtack, Google Local Service Ads).

This doubles as a monetization path for the software provider.

🔑 What You Can Build In (Without Huge Costs)

Here’s what you can give your customers as a “built-in marketing toolkit” without buying an expensive package:

Email + SMS Campaigns (Lightweight CRM)

Use Twilio (SMS) and SendGrid/Postmark (email).

Build simple campaign templates: promotions, reminders, seasonal checkups (“Spring HVAC tune-up!”).

Customers set recipient filters (e.g., “all active customers in X zip code”) → you auto-send.

Reputation Management

Auto-send review requests after jobs (email + SMS).

One-click link to Google Reviews or Yelp.

Track review status in-app (did they open the link? did they leave feedback?).

Referral System

Add a simple “refer a friend” link generator.

Customer shares link → tracked discount/credit applied.

This drives growth without ad spend.

Social Media Post Scheduler (Basic)

Integrate with Meta Business Suite (Facebook/Instagram) and Google My Business.

Pre-set templates for promotions → one-click publish.

Local SEO Helpers

Automatically keep customer’s business info synced across platforms (Google Maps, Yelp, Apple Maps) via something like Yext API (or build a lightweight version).

Direct Mail (Optional)

Use Lob.com API or Postalytics to auto-generate postcards or flyers.

Example: “Send postcards to all customers who haven’t booked in 6 months.”

⚡ Why This Matters

Instead of charging extra like ServiceTitan, you can bundle a lightweight marketing suite directly in the SMB version of your app.

Even if you later gate advanced marketing features (bulk email, campaign analytics) behind Pro+ or Enterprise tiers, customers will love having “done-for-you marketing” as part of the app.

This makes your app not just an operations tool but a growth tool, which is a massive value-add.
