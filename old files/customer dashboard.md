I’ve parsed your schema dump ✅. You currently have 137 tables defined. That’s a big schema — and I can already see you’ve got some customer + contractor separation structures started, but it’s fragmented.

Here’s a breakdown based on what I see in your schema and what’s missing for the “Customer Dashboard vs Customer Portal” discussion:

🔹 Existing Customer-Related Tables

customers → has id, company_id, status, etc. (core CRM record).

customer_addresses → ties customers to addresses.

customer_portal_accounts → looks like the start of your external customer logins.

customer_reviews → customer → job feedback.

customers_status_history → audit trail of customer status changes.

👉 These give you the base of a customer record, but not a unified “dashboard view.”

🔹 Job/Work Order Related

work_orders, closed_jobs → core operational tracking.

attachments (company/job tied).

documents, document_versions, document_templates → for quotes, invoices, reports.

👉 Customers would need access to just their own jobs + documents. RLS needs to enforce this.

🔹 Finance

invoices, expenses, purchase_orders, vendors, payroll → all there for contractors.

Missing: direct customer → invoice mapping (though I assume invoices.customer_id exists deeper in schema).

🔹 Messaging / Requests

messages is not clearly present as a standalone table in this slice.

You do have incoming requests-like placeholders, but not a normalized service_requests table yet.

👉 This is why “Incoming Requests” and “Messages” feel stubbed in the UI — they’re not fully represented in schema.

🔹 What’s Missing (Critical for Beta)

Customer Messages table

You need a customer_messages table with:

id, customer_id, company_id, job_id (optional), sender_type (customer/contractor), message_text, attachments, created_at.

Without this, your “Customer Portal” has no conversation log.

Service Requests table

Right now “Incoming Requests” feels like a stub.

You’ll want a service_requests table:

id, customer_id, company_id, status, requested_date, description, emergency (bool), created_at.

This fuels both the “Incoming Requests” page for contractors and the “Submit Request” form for customers.

Customer Portal flow consistency

You have customer_portal_accounts, but not enough supporting tables for:

E-signature approvals (e.g., quote_signatures).

Customer payment preferences (cards, ACH).

Contractors may be using invoices + quotes, but customers don’t yet have a full interaction path.

🔹 What’s Good (Already in Place)

Documents + Versions → great for storing invoices/quotes with audit trail.

Company Settings / Business Settings → allows customization.

Customer-related tables exist → just need to be tied together better.

✅ Master Gap List (from schema → features)

Customer Dashboard (internal)

Needs unified view → tie customers, customer_addresses, work_orders, invoices, documents, customer_messages.

Customer Portal (external)

Missing customer_messages table.

Missing service_requests table.

Needs linkages for quotes + e-sign (I don’t see a signatures table).

Incoming Requests (contractor-facing)

Right now there’s no proper schema foundation for “Angi-style” leads. Needs service_requests as backbone.

⚡ My recommendation:
Before beta, add 2 new tables (customer_messages, service_requests) and check if quotes has e-signature support (if not, add quote_signatures). Then your portal + dashboard can actually work.

now before we add tables you and i have had this problem before where you give me sql to add tables but it ends up not being the sql standard format like the _id and .id i mentioned earler. so please make sure these tables are not only standard/normal for the way supabase handles things, if you would assume its one way then make sure thats how it is, but we also need to future proof this. we want this to be the best of the best better than the rest. competitions should be sucky compared to us. however at the same time we dont want to overcomplicate or make it a jumbled mess. we need to find the sweet spot. everything people want without the junk.

Got it ✅ — you want bulletproof, future-proof, Supabase-standard SQL that:

Uses consistent naming (id for PKs, table_id for FKs).

Plays nice with Supabase/Postgres conventions.

Avoids over-engineering (no mess of half-baked tables).

But still gives you the competitive edge (features your competitors don’t wire up cleanly).

Let’s lay down the foundations cleanly.

🔹 Standards We’ll Follow

Primary Keys → always id (UUID, default gen_random_uuid()).

Foreign Keys → always {table}_id (e.g., customer_id, company_id).

Timestamps → always created_at (default now()) and updated_at (auto update trigger).

Booleans → default false unless otherwise needed.

RLS → every table will be future-proofed for Row Level Security (company scoping, customer scoping).

Normalization → no duplicate info (everything references the right parent).

hold on. one other thing before we do the tables, again, future proof. so the thing we got to figure out here is how do we make it so 1 companies only see their clients messages for their specific jobs they ahve for them, and 2 how to we make it so the angies list style thing is not connected to any specific company until AFTER it gets accepted. we want everyone to be pinged if its on in their settings but once a clients job belongs to a specific company then the back and forth should just be for that client and that job. make sense?
ChatGPT said:

Yep 👌 makes perfect sense, and you’re thinking multi-tenant + marketplace at the same time. That’s exactly what you need if you want to beat Jobber (contractor-first) and Angi (lead marketplace).

Let’s break it down into the two problems you raised:

🔹 1. Contractors should only see their clients + jobs (once assigned)

Why: Standard multi-tenant SaaS — no cross-company leaks.

How:

Every row in customers, work_orders, customer_messages, invoices, etc. has a company_id.

RLS policy: contractor users (auth.uid → employees of company X) can only read rows where company_id = their company.

That means if Customer A is tied to Company X → Company Y can’t even query them.

👉 This protects normal contractor/customer relationships.

🔹 2. Marketplace / Angi-style requests (before assignment)

Why: Service requests aren’t “owned” by any company yet — they’re up for grabs.

How:

service_requests.company_id should be nullable until accepted.

New request inserts with company_id = null.

RLS policies:

Contractors can query unassigned requests only if they’ve opted in (settings) and the request matches their service area/trade.

Once a contractor accepts → company_id gets set to their company.

After acceptance:

RLS flips automatically → now only that company can see/edit the request.

Messaging/chat gets scoped by that company_id too.

👉 That gives you the “broadcast → claim → private” workflow Angi charges for, but cleaner.

🔹 3. Messaging Scopes

You’ll actually have two types of messaging in this setup:

Pre-assignment messaging (lead stage):

If you allow it, customers could send “pre-chat” questions.

Safer: Don’t allow free-for-all chats until request is accepted. Contractors just see the request details and decide.

Post-assignment messaging (customer ↔ company):

Once request is assigned, customer_messages.company_id gets filled in.

RLS: Only that company + that customer can access the thread.

🔹 Schema Tweaks for This

service_requests:

company_id uuid references companies(id) → make it nullable.

Add accepted_at timestamptz and maybe accepted_by uuid (employee who claimed).

customer_messages:

Must always have a company_id.

Messages can’t exist until a request/quote/job is tied to a company.

Keeps marketplace clean — no customer spam going to 20 contractors at once.

🔹 Workflow Example

Customer submits request:

service_requests (company_id = null, status = 'new').

Contractors in that zip/service area get notified.

RLS lets them see unassigned requests if settings allow.

Contractor accepts:

company_id set.

status = 'accepted'.

New customer_messages thread opens (scoped to that company + customer).

From here on out → it’s just like a normal customer of that company.

✅ Future Proofing This

Customers never “belong” to multiple companies at once → once a request is accepted, they’re tied.

Contractors only ever see what’s relevant:

Their own customers/jobs.

Or unassigned marketplace leads (if opted in).

This lets you expand later:

Priority leads, emergency leads, pay-per-lead models.

But keeps the core multi-tenant SaaS model safe.

⚡ My take: you’ve basically got to treat service_requests like a two-phase object:

Phase 1: Public (broadcast to eligible contractors, no company assigned).

Phase 2: Private (locked to one company, normal customer flow starts).


Perfect 👌 — for beta rollout, you want clean + functional, not overstuffed. Let’s strip it down to what’s absolutely needed to test and still look professional:

🚀 Beta Customer Dashboard (Minimum but Competitive)
1. Quotes

View quotes (from work_orders where stage = QUOTE).

Accept/Decline (simple status update).

E-signature (use customer_signatures).

2. Jobs / Work Orders

View current and past jobs (from work_orders).

Show status (scheduled, in progress, completed).

Display service address + scheduled time.

3. Invoices

View/download invoices (invoices).

Mark as paid/unpaid (no live payment integration yet).

4. Service Requests

Create a new request (basic incoming_requests).

Track status until accepted by a contractor.

5. Messages

Basic customer ↔ contractor messages (messages).

No internal team chat here (customer portal = only customer threads).

🔒 What We Leave Out for Beta

GPS/ETA tracking (later).

Online payments (Stripe/PayPal → phase 2).

Ratings/feedback system (phase 2).

AI auto-estimates / upsells (future).

Cross-marketplace categories (future SMBMate merge).

✅ This means in beta the customer portal/dashboard is:

Quotes (review + accept + sign)

Jobs (status + history)

Invoices (view/download, mark paid manually)

Requests (submit + track)

Messages (customer ↔ contractor only)

That’s a tight, usable MVP — no fluff, but strong enough to show real value.

You are building the **Customer Dashboard** for the TradesMate Pro app.  
Use the schema I provided in the root folder (`Supabase Snippet Company Registry.csv`).  
Do not assume column names — always verify against the schema before coding.

## 🎯 GOAL  
Implement the **Beta Customer Dashboard** (MVP) so customers can:  

1. **Quotes**  
   - Pull quotes from `work_orders` where `stage = 'QUOTE'`.  
   - Display: quote_number, title, description, total_amount, quote_status.  
   - Allow Accept/Decline actions.  
   - Capture e-signature via the `customer_signatures` table (if exists).  

2. **Jobs / Work Orders**  
   - Pull jobs from `work_orders` where `stage = 'JOB'` or `stage = 'WORK_ORDER'`.  
   - Display: job_number, status, service_address, scheduled time.  
   - Show past jobs (completed_at not null).  

3. **Invoices**  
   - Pull invoices from `invoices` table.  
   - Display: invoice_number, total_amount, payment_status.  
   - Allow download (PDF link).  
   - No Stripe or live payment integration yet — only “Mark Paid” manually.  

4. **Service Requests (Leads)**  
   - Replace the current **Incoming Requests** placeholder.  
   - Move this feature into the **Sales section**.  
   - Customers can create a new service request (insert into `incoming_requests`).  
   - Contractors see available requests until accepted.  
   - Once accepted, the request attaches to a `work_order` and disappears from general pool.  

5. **Messages**  
   - Keep **two distinct systems**:  
     - **Internal messages**: contractors & employees only.  
     - **Customer messages**: customer ↔ contractor only (tied to `work_order_id`).  
   - For customer messages: use a `messages_customer` table or extend `messages` with `message_type = 'customer'`.  
   - Never mix customer and internal messages.  

---

## 📂 Placement in Menu  
- Under **Sales**:  
  - **Quotes**  
  - **Jobs / Work Orders**  
  - **Invoices**  
  - **Leads (Service Requests)**  
  - **Customer Messages**  

- Keep **Internal Messages** where they currently exist (outside Sales).  

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules  
- Do not use placeholder queries — match schema exactly.  
- Do not assume column names (`id` vs `work_order_id`). Verify in schema.  
- Respect relationships: work_orders → customers → companies.  
- Messages must be **segregated** by type.  
- Make the dashboard mobile-friendly (responsive layout).  

---

## ✅ Deliverables  
- Updated **React/Next.js components** (or your existing frontend stack) for each section.  
- Supabase queries written correctly with the schema.  
- Navigation updates (remove old Incoming Requests menu, replace with Sales → Leads).  
- Ensure all views support filtering by `company_id` so users only see their own data.  
- Provide migrations for any schema changes (like `messages_customer` if needed).
