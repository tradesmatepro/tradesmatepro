## ðŸš€ Phase 4 Enterprise (GPT + Claude Merged)

**ServiceTitan Enterprise Parity** (~22 tables, smart consolidation)

```

### **Advanced Workforce Management**

**Phase 4 Total: ~22 additional tables**
**Grand Enterprise Total: ~87 tables**

**Key Consolidations Made:**
- Photos â†’ use existing attachments table
- Estimates â†’ use work_orders with estimate status
- Customer contracts â†’ use service_agreements from Phase 2
- Performance dashboards â†’ generate dynamically from metrics

This would put you at ServiceTitan Enterprise level with unique marketplace advantage.
