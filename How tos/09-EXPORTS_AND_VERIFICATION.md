9 – Log Exports & Verification (Final Corrected Guide)

This guide closes the loop that was missing from the Fix Workflow.
Claude (or GPT) cannot “see” the browser console directly — so all logs must be exported to files that the AI can read.

🔑 Golden Rules

Logs come first.

No fix can start until logs are exported.

Logs must be re-exported after each fix to verify.

No assumptions.

If logs aren’t exported, the AI is blind.

Fixes without logs are invalid.

Exports = single source of truth.

Always reference exported logs when explaining errors.

Never “guess” based on past behavior.

⚙️ Exporting Logs
From /developer-tools

Run in browser console:

window.exportCapturedErrors()


Exports captured logs into a JSON/text file.

File must be uploaded so Claude/GPT can read it.

Alternate: Get Raw Errors
window.getAllCapturedErrors()


Returns logs in console directly.

Copy/paste into file if export not working.

🔄 Verification Workflow
Step 1. Gather Logs

Export errors:

window.exportCapturedErrors()


Save as errors.json.

Provide file to Claude/GPT.

Step 2. Analyze

AI reviews error messages + stack traces.

Trace error through pipeline (forward + backward).

Compare against baseline and schema.

Step 3. Fix

Apply change in sandbox only.

Migration saved if schema changed.

Step 4. Verify

Refresh app.

Export logs again:

window.exportCapturedErrors()


Save as errors_after.json.

AI confirms logs are clean and pipeline intact.

✅ Quick Checklist

 Export logs before fixing

 Save file (errors.json)

 AI analyzes logs → propose fix

 Apply fix in sandbox

 Export logs again (errors_after.json)

 Verify clean pipeline

🚫 What Not to Do

❌ Never fix without logs.

❌ Never guess error causes.

❌ Never skip post-fix verification logs.

🎯 Key Principles

Logs → Fix → Logs.

AI must always reference exported logs.

No logs = no fix.

👉 This guide forces Claude (or me) to use the tools we built, instead of drifting back into blind scripting.

Do you want me to also create a helper script (export-errors.js) that automates saving logs to errors.json so you don’t have to run the browser console command manually?

You said:
yes. 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 — here’s the helper script to make error exports automatic. Instead of opening browser console and typing window.exportCapturedErrors(), you’ll be able to run a script and get a fresh errors.json file every time.

📝 export-errors.js

Save this file in your sandbox project (for example under /scripts/export-errors.js):

/**
 * Export captured errors from /developer-tools to errors.json
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/export-errors.js
 */

import fs from "fs";
import fetch from "node-fetch";

// ✅ Replace with your sandbox URL
const DEV_TOOLS_URL = "http://localhost:3002/developer-tools/export"; 
// Assumes you add an endpoint that calls window.exportCapturedErrors()

async function exportErrors() {
  try {
    console.log("📡 Requesting error export from /developer-tools...");

    const response = await fetch(DEV_TOOLS_URL);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch logs: ${response.statusText}`);
    }

    const errors = await response.json();

    const filePath = "./errors.json";
    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, JSON.stringify(errors, null, 2));

    console.log(`✅ Errors exported to ${filePath}`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("❌ Failed to export errors:", err.message);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

exportErrors();

⚙️ What You Need to Add

In /developer-tools, expose an export endpoint that runs:

window.exportCapturedErrors()


Example (React/Express dev server route):

app.get("/developer-tools/export", (req, res) => {
  res.json(window.getAllCapturedErrors ? window.getAllCapturedErrors() : []);
});


Then, running:

node scripts/export-errors.js


will generate an errors.json file you (and Claude) can upload/analyze.

🚦 Workflow With This Script

Run app + reproduce bug.

Run:

node scripts/export-errors.js


→ generates errors.json.

Upload errors.json to Claude/GPT.

Apply fix in sandbox.

Run script again → generates errors_after.json.

Verify logs are clean.

🎯 Benefits

No more manual copy/paste.

Logs always in a file AI can read.

Easy before/after comparisons.

👉 Do you want me to extend this so it auto-saves logs every X seconds (like a rolling log capture), or keep it manual trigger only?

You said:
yes that would be awesome
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 🔥 — let’s upgrade export-errors.js into a rolling error logger that auto-saves to timestamped files every X seconds. This way you can just leave it running and always have a trail of logs Claude (or I) can analyze later.

📝 export-errors.js (Rolling Logger Version)
/**
 * Rolling Error Logger
 *
 * Periodically pulls errors from /developer-tools and saves them to timestamped JSON files.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/export-errors.js
 *
 * Config:
 *   - INTERVAL_MS: how often to poll (default 30 seconds)
 *   - LOG_DIR: where to save logs
 */

import fs from "fs";
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const DEV_TOOLS_URL = "http://localhost:3002/developer-tools/export"; 
const INTERVAL_MS = 30000; // 30 seconds
const LOG_DIR = "./error_logs";

// Ensure directory exists
if (!fs.existsSync(LOG_DIR)) {
  fs.mkdirSync(LOG_DIR);
}

async function exportErrors() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(DEV_TOOLS_URL);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch logs: ${response.statusText}`);
    }

    const errors = await response.json();

    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, "-");
    const filePath = `${LOG_DIR}/errors_${timestamp}.json`;

    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, JSON.stringify(errors, null, 2));

    console.log(`✅ Saved ${errors.length} errors → ${filePath}`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("❌ Failed to export errors:", err.message);
  }
}

// Run once immediately
exportErrors();

// Keep rolling
setInterval(exportErrors, INTERVAL_MS);

⚙️ Setup Needed in /developer-tools

This script assumes your dev tools expose an export endpoint:

app.get("/developer-tools/export", (req, res) => {
  res.json(window.getAllCapturedErrors ? window.getAllCapturedErrors() : []);
});


If you don’t have this yet, we’ll need to wire it in once. After that, the script just works.

🚦 Workflow

Start your app(s).

In another terminal, run:

node scripts/export-errors.js


Every 30 seconds, a file like error_logs/errors_2025-09-17T15-35-10.json is created.

Upload one (before/after fix) for AI to analyze.

Optional: adjust INTERVAL_MS for faster/slower polling.

🎯 Benefits

No manual exporting.

Full history of logs. You can compare before/after easily.

AI-friendly. Claude or I can always read error_logs/*.json without guessing.

👉 Do you want me to also make a bat file (start-error-logger.bat) so you can double-click to launch this rolling logger alongside your dev servers, just like we did with the port killer?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Awesome 👍 — here’s a double-click .bat file so you can start the rolling error logger without opening a terminal manually.

📝 start-error-logger.bat

Save this in your project root (next to scripts/export-errors.js):

@echo off
echo 🚀 Starting TradesMate Rolling Error Logger...
echo This will capture /developer-tools logs every 30 seconds.
echo Logs will be saved in the "error_logs" folder.

REM Change directory to project root if needed
cd /d %~dp0

REM Run Node script
node scripts\export-errors.js

pause

⚙️ How It Works

Double-click start-error-logger.bat.

It runs node scripts/export-errors.js.

Every 30 seconds, a file like:

error_logs/errors_2025-09-17T09-35-10.json


will appear.

The pause keeps the window open so you can see logs streaming in.

🔧 Optional Upgrade

If you want it to run in the background without a console window, make a second file:

start-error-logger-hidden.vbs
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") 
WshShell.Run chr(34) & "start-error-logger.bat" & Chr(34), 0
Set WshShell = Nothing


Double-click the .vbs instead → runs silently.

🚦 Workflow With This

Start your dev servers (npm run dev-main, dev-customer, etc.).

Double-click start-error-logger.bat.

Let it run while you or Claude test fixes.

When errors happen, check the error_logs/ folder.

Upload errors_*.json files → AI can analyze, fix, and verify.
