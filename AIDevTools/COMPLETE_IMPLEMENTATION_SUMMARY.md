## 🔄 The Complete Loop

```
USER: "Test the OnHold modal"
    ↓
AI: Reads UI_INTERACTION_GUIDE.md
    ↓

COMMAND EXECUTOR: Detects change
    ↓
ACTION-OUTCOME MONITOR: Executes with monitoring
    ├─ Captures state BEFORE
    ├─ Clicks button

## 💡 Before vs After

### Before (The Problem)
```
AI: "I'll test the save button"
AI: *inserts data via backend*
AI: "✅ Test complete!"

Reality: Frontend is broken, button doesn't work
User: "But it doesn't work when I click it!"
AI: "Let me insert more data..."
```

### After Part 1 (Interaction)
```
AI: "I'll test the save button"
AI: *actually clicks button in browser*
AI: "✅ Button clicked!"

Reality: Button clicked but nothing happened
User: "Did it actually work?"
AI: "I clicked it... moving to next step"
```

### After Part 2 (Reasoning)
```
AI: "I'll test the save button"
AI: *clicks button with monitoring*
AI: "❌ Button click failed!"
AI: "Reasoning: No DOM changes, no network activity"
AI: "Suggestions: Check click handler, verify element not disabled"
AI: "Let me analyze the code..."
AI: *finds missing onClick handler*
AI: "Found the issue! The onClick handler isn't wired up."
AI: "Here's the fix..."
```

## 🎮 Example Usage

### Test OnHold Modal (Complete Flow)

**Step 1: AI writes command**
```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "id": "cmd_test_onhold",
      "command": "ui_click_monitored",
      "params": {
        "selector": "select[name='job_status']",
        "expectations": {
          "shouldShowModal": true,
          "shouldChangeDom": true
        }
      },
      "timestamp": "2025-10-06T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2: System executes with monitoring**
- Captures state before
- Clicks element
- Captures state after
- Analyzes changes
- Evaluates expectations

**Step 3: AI receives result**
```json
{
  "id": "cmd_test_onhold",
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "success": false,
    "label": "Click select[name='job_status']",
    "evidence": {
      "domChanged": true,
      "newElementsAppeared": [],
      "visualChange": true
    },
    "reasoning": "Expected modal to appear but no modal appeared",
    "suggestions": [
      "Check if modal trigger is wired correctly",
      "Verify modal component is imported and rendered",
      "Check if modal state management is working"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Step 4: AI analyzes and responds**
```
❌ OnHold modal test FAILED

Evidence:
- DOM changed (dropdown value updated)
- No modal appeared
- No new dialog elements detected

Reasoning:
The status change triggered but the modal didn't open.

Possible causes:
1. Modal trigger not wired to status change
2. Modal component not imported
3. Modal state management broken

Let me check the code...
```

**Step 5: AI finds and fixes issue**
```javascript
// Found: Missing modal trigger in handleStatusChange
// Fix: Add modal trigger when status === 'on_hold'

if (newStatus === 'on_hold') {
  setShowOnHoldModal(true);
}
```

**Step 6: AI re-tests**
```
✅ OnHold modal test PASSED

Evidence:
- DOM changed
- Modal appeared (DIALOG element detected)
- Visual change confirmed

Reasoning:
All expectations met: modal appeared, DOM changed

Screenshot: onhold-modal-success.png
```
