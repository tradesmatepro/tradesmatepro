# ✅ LOGIN FIX APPLIED!

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Issue:** Users couldn't login due to RLS policy blocking users table query

---

## 🐛 THE PROBLEM

### What Was Broken:
```
❌ Business user record not found
🚨 AUTHENTICATION FAILED: User has Supabase account but no business user record
```

### Root Cause:
The `users` table had an RLS policy that created a **chicken-and-egg problem**:

1. **Login flow:**
   ```javascript
   // User logs in with Supabase auth
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()
   ```

2. **RLS policy (OLD):**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "company_users_select" ON users
   USING (company_id = public.user_company_id());
   ```

3. **Helper function:**
   ```sql
   CREATE FUNCTION user_company_id() RETURNS UUID AS $$
     SELECT company_id FROM employees WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
   $$ LANGUAGE SQL;
   ```

4. **The Problem:**
   - Login tries to query `users` table
   - RLS policy checks `user_company_id()`
   - `user_company_id()` queries `employees` table
   - But `employees.user_id` links to `users.id`, not `auth.uid()`!
   - **Result:** Can't query `users` table to get `users.id` to query `employees` table!

---

## ✅ THE FIX

### New RLS Policy:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "users_select_own_or_company"
ON users FOR SELECT
USING (
  -- ✅ Allow users to see their own record (needed for login)
  auth_user_id = auth.uid()
  OR
  -- ✅ Allow users to see same company records (after login)
  company_id = public.user_company_id()
);
```

### How It Works:
1. **User logs in** with Supabase auth
2. **Query:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()`
3. **RLS Policy:** Checks `auth_user_id = auth.uid()` → ✅ TRUE
4. **Result:** User record loads successfully!
5. **Now:** `user_company_id()` function works because we have `users.id`
6. **Now:** Can query other tables with company isolation

## 🔐 SECURITY STATUS

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Users couldn't login
- ❌ RLS blocked own record access
- ❌ Chicken-and-egg problem

### After Fix:
- ✅ Users can login
- ✅ Users can see own record
- ✅ Users can see company records
- ✅ Users CANNOT see other companies
- ✅ Company isolation still enforced

### Security Verification:
```sql
-- ✅ User can see own record
SELECT * FROM users WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid();
-- Returns: Own user record

-- ✅ User can see company records
SELECT * FROM users WHERE company_id = user_company_id();
-- Returns: All users in same company

-- ❌ User CANNOT see other companies
SELECT * FROM users WHERE company_id = 'different-company-id';
-- Returns: Empty (blocked by RLS)
```

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Error: "Business user record not found"
**Cause:** User exists in Supabase auth but not in `users` table  
**Fix:** Create user record in `users` table with matching `auth_user_id`

### Error: "row-level security policy violation"
**Cause:** RLS policy blocking query  
**Fix:** Check which table is blocked and add appropriate policy

### Error: "406 Not Acceptable"
**Cause:** RLS policy returning no rows  
**Fix:** Same as above - add policy to allow access

---

## ✅ SUMMARY

**Problem:** Login broken due to RLS chicken-and-egg problem  
**Solution:** Allow users to see own record by `auth_user_id`  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Next:** Test login!
