# 🔍 **Calendar Debug Approach - Step by Step**

## 🎯 **New Strategy: Progressive Debugging**

Instead of complex joins that might fail, I've implemented a progressive approach that tries simpler queries first and adds complexity only if needed.

### **Step 1: Simple schedule_events Query** ✅
```javascript
schedule_events?company_id=eq.${companyId}&order=start_time.asc
```
- No joins initially
- Just basic table query
- Comprehensive logging to see what happens

### **Step 2: Enrich Data if Needed** ✅
If schedule_events exist, enrich them with:
- Work order details (separate query)
- Customer details (separate query)  
- Employee details (separate query)

### **Step 3: Fallback to Work Orders** ✅
If no schedule_events, try work_orders directly:
```javascript
work_orders?company_id=eq.${companyId}&start_time=not.is.null&end_time=not.is.null
```

### **Step 4: Basic Formatting** ✅
Multiple formatting methods for different data sources:
- `formatEnrichedEvent()` - For enriched schedule_events
- `formatBasicEvent()` - For basic schedule_events
- `formatWorkOrderAsBasicEvent()` - For work_orders

## 🔍 **Debug Logging Added**

The service now logs every step:
- `🔄 Loading calendar events - trying simple approach...`
- `📡 Query: [actual query]`
- `✅ Raw schedule_events: [data]`
- `✅ Enriched events: X`
- `⚠️ No schedule_events found, trying work_orders...`
- `✅ Work order events: X`
- `❌ Failed to load schedule_events: [error]`
- `🔄 Falling back to work_orders...`

## 🎯 **What This Will Tell Us**

### **If schedule_events table exists:**
- You'll see: `✅ Raw schedule_events: [data]`
- We'll know if the table has data

### **If schedule_events table doesn't exist:**
- You'll see: `❌ Failed to load schedule_events: [error]`
- We'll fall back to work_orders

### **If work_orders has scheduling data:**
- You'll see: `✅ Work order events: X`
- Calendar will show work orders as events

### **If no data exists:**
- You'll see all the queries and their results
- We'll know exactly what tables/data are available

## 🚀 **Expected Outcomes**

### **Best Case:**
- schedule_events table exists with data
- Events load and display on calendar
- Enrichment adds customer/employee names

### **Fallback Case:**
- schedule_events empty/missing
- work_orders with scheduling data loads
- Calendar shows work orders as events

### **Debug Case:**
- Detailed logs show exactly what's happening
- We can see which tables exist and what data they contain
- Can adjust approach based on actual schema

## 📊 **Next Steps Based on Results**

### **If you see schedule_events data:**
- Calendar should work
- May need to adjust enrichment queries

### **If you see work_orders data:**
- Calendar should show work orders
- May need to create schedule_events sync

### **If you see query errors:**
- We'll know exact table/column names that exist
- Can adjust queries to match your schema

### **If you see no data:**
- We'll create test data or adjust data sources
- May need to look at different tables

## 🔧 **How to Use Debug Info**

1. **Open browser console**
2. **Refresh calendar page**
3. **Look for the debug messages**
4. **Share the console output**

The logs will tell us exactly:
- Which tables exist
- What data is available
- Where the queries are failing
- What the actual response data looks like

**This approach will definitely identify the root cause and get your calendar working!** 🎯
