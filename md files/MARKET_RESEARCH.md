Contractor Discovery: Enables real-time contractor visibility for customers ‚Äî a search-like experience to browse or connect with available professionals. A first-of-its-kind mobile-first contractor marketplace focused on small teams.

Real-Time Messaging: Secure in-app messaging between customer and contractor, including quote clarification, appointment changes, and job updates. Supports push notifications and potential photo sharing.
