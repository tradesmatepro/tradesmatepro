‚úÖ The Correct Lifecycle Buckets

Here‚Äôs the ‚Äúright way‚Äù for jobs to flow:

Active Jobs

job_status = DRAFT | SCHEDULED | IN_PROGRESS

Awaiting Invoice

job_status = COMPLETED AND no invoice yet

Awaiting Payment

job_status = COMPLETED AND invoice exists AND invoice.status ‚àà (UNPAID, OVERDUE, PARTIAL_PAID)

Closed Jobs

job_status = COMPLETED AND invoice exists AND invoice.status = PAID

üõ†Ô∏è Fixed SQL View

Here‚Äôs the corrected version:

-- First run fix_invoice_status_constraint.sql, then run this:

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.jobs_with_payment_status;

CREATE VIEW public.jobs_with_payment_status AS
SELECT
  w.id AS work_order_id,
  w.company_id,
  w.customer_id,
  w.job_number,
  w.title,
  w.description,
  w.job_status,
  w.work_status,
  w.stage,
  w.start_time,
  w.end_time,
  w.actual_start_time,
  w.actual_end_time,
  w.assigned_technician_id,
  w.total_amount,
  w.created_at,
  w.updated_at,
  i.id AS invoice_id,
  i.invoice_number,
  i.status AS invoice_status,
  c.name AS customer_name,
  c.email AS customer_email,
  c.phone AS customer_phone,

  -- üîë Lifecycle buckets
  CASE
    WHEN w.job_status IN ('DRAFT','SCHEDULED','IN_PROGRESS')
      THEN 'active_job'
    WHEN w.job_status = 'COMPLETED' AND i.id IS NULL
      THEN 'awaiting_invoice'
    WHEN w.job_status = 'COMPLETED' AND i.id IS NOT NULL
         AND i.status IN ('DRAFT','SENT','UNPAID','OVERDUE','PARTIAL_PAID','PARTIALLY_PAID')
      THEN 'awaiting_payment'
    WHEN w.job_status = 'COMPLETED' AND i.id IS NOT NULL
         AND i.status = 'PAID'
      THEN 'closed_job'
    ELSE 'active_job'
  END AS unified_status

FROM public.work_orders w
LEFT JOIN public.invoices i ON i.id = w.invoice_id
LEFT JOIN public.customers c ON c.id = w.customer_id;

GRANT SELECT ON public.jobs_with_payment_status TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.jobs_with_payment_status TO anon;

‚úÖ End Result (Your Case)

Active Jobs ‚Üí still only the open jobs.

Invoices ‚Üí still lists all invoices (independent of jobs).

Closed Jobs ‚Üí now only shows jobs with invoices that are actually PAID.

Awaiting Payment ‚Üí shows the two invoiced but unpaid jobs.

Awaiting Invoice ‚Üí shows the job marked completed but not invoiced yet.

üëâ Do you want me to also draft the frontend filter logic so your Active / Closed tabs only pull the right unified_status values (instead of mixing in invoices), so everything lines up visually?

You said:
sno no no. im not running another sql until we figure out the actual way we are doing this. cause yo usaid the issues was also in the front end. we cant change status or dont have the right status in invoices to move them? i need both yo uand the ai in studio and me to be on the same page otherwise we waste another 5 hours fixing this again

‚úÖ That‚Äôs the right call ‚Äî don‚Äôt touch SQL again until we lock down the actual lifecycle rules and make sure the frontend + Supabase + your workflow all agree. Otherwise we‚Äôll just keep chasing symptoms.

üîé Where the Mismatch Is Coming From

Jobs pipeline (work_orders.job_status)

Tracks the operational lifecycle ‚Üí Draft ‚Üí Scheduled ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed.

This part works.

Invoices pipeline (invoices.status)

Should track the financial lifecycle ‚Üí Draft/Sent/Unpaid ‚Üí Paid.

But your schema / UI doesn‚Äôt expose all the states correctly:

Sometimes invoices stay in DRAFT even when they‚Äôre emailed.

Sometimes frontend shows UNPAID when DB still says DRAFT.

Unified view (jobs_with_payment_status)

Is trying to merge the two, but it can only work if the invoice statuses are correct.

Right now, jobs with invoices look like ‚ÄúClosed‚Äù because the status is missing or mismatched.

‚úÖ What Needs to Happen (before SQL)

We need to align the status system so Supabase + frontend agree on the same states:

Job Statuses (work_orders.job_status)

DRAFT, SCHEDULED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED

These are fine, don‚Äôt change.

Invoice Statuses (invoices.status)

Must be consistent, and frontend must always write them correctly.

Suggest we standardize on:

DRAFT = created but not sent

SENT = emailed to customer

UNPAID = customer owes money

OVERDUE = unpaid past due date

PAID = settled

Frontend Rules

When creating invoice ‚Üí default status = DRAFT.

When sending invoice ‚Üí flip status = SENT.

When payment recorded ‚Üí flip status = PAID.

Stop using work_orders.payment_status in UI ‚Äî only use invoices.status.

Unified View Rules (SQL only works once statuses are right):

Active = job still in progress.

Awaiting Invoice = job completed but no invoice.

Awaiting Payment = job completed + invoice.status ‚àà (SENT, UNPAID, OVERDUE).

Closed = job completed + invoice.status = PAID.

üö¶ Why We Got Out of Sync

Frontend was half-using work_orders.payment_status and half-using invoices.status.

Invoice creation didn‚Äôt always flip the status (stuck at DRAFT).

The view logic wasn‚Äôt wrong ‚Äî the data feeding it was.

‚úÖ Next Step (Before Touching SQL Again)

We should:

Confirm allowed invoice statuses in Supabase right now ‚Üí do they include DRAFT, SENT, UNPAID, PAID, etc.?

Update frontend so invoice edit + send actions actually update invoices.status.

Drop work_orders.payment_status from frontend to avoid conflicts.

Once that‚Äôs in place ‚Üí the SQL view we wrote earlier will behave exactly how you expect (Active, Awaiting Invoice, Awaiting Payment, Closed). 
1. Invalid Field(s) in Payload

Supabase 400 usually means:

You‚Äôre sending a field that doesn‚Äôt exist in the table.

Or sending null / wrong type into a non-nullable column.

From your log, the payload contains:

{
  tax_rate: 0,
  discount_amount: 0,
  items: [ {‚Ä¶} ],
  totals: { ‚Ä¶ }
}


üëâ Problem:

items and totals are not columns in invoices (they belong in invoice_items or should be computed, not stored in invoices).

Supabase REST doesn‚Äôt know what to do with them ‚Üí rejects with 400.

2. Status Field Not Updating

Frontend might still be trying to write status: 'UNPAID' when DB only accepts DRAFT | SENT | PAID | OVERDUE.

That explains ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù in DB vs ‚ÄúUnpaid‚Äù in UI.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix
Step 1. Fix Update Payload

In InvoicesService.js, when calling Supabase update, only send fields that actually exist in invoices table.
Example:

const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('invoices')
  .update({
    status: invoice.status,        // must be a valid enum
    tax_rate: invoice.tax_rate,
    discount_amount: invoice.discount_amount,
    updated_at: new Date()
  })
  .eq('id', invoice.id);


üëâ Do not send items or totals in this call.
Instead, update invoice_items table separately.

Step 2. Align Invoice Statuses

Confirm the enum in DB:

select unnest(enum_range(null::invoice_status_enum));


Make frontend dropdown match those values exactly.

If DB doesn‚Äôt allow UNPAID but frontend uses it, replace with SENT or whatever matches your schema.

Step 3. UI Cleanup

In InvoiceFormModal.js, strip out items and totals before calling updateInvoice.

Example:

const payload = {
  id: invoice.id,
  status: invoice.status,
  tax_rate: invoice.tax_rate || 0,
  discount_amount: invoice.discount_amount || 0,
};

InvoicesService.updateInvoice(payload);

üö¶ End Result

PATCH will succeed (no more 400).

Invoice status will update properly in DB.

UI will show the same value everywhere (‚ÄúDraft‚Äù until sent, ‚ÄúPaid‚Äù when closed).

Line items stay in invoice_items where they belong, not in invoices.
