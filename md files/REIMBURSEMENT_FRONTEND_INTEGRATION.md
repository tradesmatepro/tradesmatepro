# 💰 **Reimbursement Frontend Integration Complete!**

## 🔍 **You Were Right - Reimbursements Were Missing from Frontend**

The SQL had all the reimbursement workflow tables, but the frontend wasn't integrated. Here's what I fixed:

### **Problem Identified** ❌
1. **Reimbursement Request Modal** - Created but not integrated into main page
2. **No Reimbursements Tab** - Only had "Expenses" and "Reports" tabs
3. **No Reimbursement Stats** - Missing from dashboard cards
4. **No Request Button** - No way to create reimbursement requests
5. **Categories vs Workflow Confusion** - Categories had reimbursement types, but no actual request workflow

### **Frontend Integration Complete** ✅
