# 📄 Deploy Single Quote Portal Page

**Goal:** Add a standalone quote acceptance page to tradesmatepro.com WITHOUT uploading the whole app

**File:** `public-quote-portal.html`

---

## ✅ WHAT THIS IS

A **single, self-contained HTML file** that:
- ✅ Loads quote details from Supabase
- ✅ Shows quote to customer
- ✅ Allows customer to approve/reject
- ✅ Updates quote status in database
- ✅ Works completely standalone (no React, no build process)
- ✅ Can be added to ANY website

---

## 🚀 HOW TO DEPLOY (3 OPTIONS)

### Option 1: Upload to Existing Website (Recommended)

**If you have FTP/cPanel access to tradesmatepro.com:**

1. **Rename file:**
   - Rename `public-quote-portal.html` to `quote.html`

2. **Upload to website:**
   - Upload `quote.html` to your website root
   - URL will be: `https://www.tradesmatepro.com/quote.html`

3. **Test it:**
   - Get a quote ID from your database
   - Visit: `https://www.tradesmatepro.com/quote.html?id=YOUR_QUOTE_ID`

**Done!** Your placeholder site stays intact, and you have a working quote portal.

---

### Option 2: Create Subdirectory

**If you want cleaner URLs:**

1. **Create folder on website:**
   - Create folder: `/portal/`

2. **Upload file:**
   - Rename `public-quote-portal.html` to `index.html`
   - Upload to `/portal/index.html`

3. **URL will be:**
   - `https://www.tradesmatepro.com/portal/?id=YOUR_QUOTE_ID`

---

### Option 3: Use Vercel/Netlify (Separate Deployment)

**If you want to keep it completely separate:**

1. **Create new folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir quote-portal
   cd quote-portal
   ```

2. **Copy file:**
   ```bash
   copy public-quote-portal.html index.html
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel deploy
   ```

4. **Custom domain (optional):**
   - Point `quotes.tradesmatepro.com` to Vercel deployment

---

## 📧 UPDATE EMAIL LINKS

After deploying, update your quote email template to use the new URL:

**Before:**
```
View your quote: https://www.tradesmatepro.com/portal/quote/abc123
```

**After (Option 1):**
```
View your quote: https://www.tradesmatepro.com/quote.html?id=abc123
```

**After (Option 2):**
```
View your quote: https://www.tradesmatepro.com/portal/?id=abc123
```

---

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST

### Step 1: Get a Quote ID

**From your database:**
```sql
SELECT id, work_order_number, status 
FROM work_orders 
WHERE status = 'sent' 
LIMIT 1;
```

Copy the `id` value (e.g., `abc123-def456-ghi789`)

### Step 2: Test Locally First

1. **Open file in browser:**
   - Open `public-quote-portal.html` in Chrome/Firefox

2. **Add quote ID to URL:**
   - Manually edit URL to: `file:///path/to/public-quote-portal.html?id=YOUR_QUOTE_ID`

3. **Should see:**
   - Quote details load
   - Line items display
   - Total amount shows
   - Approve/Reject buttons work

### Step 3: Test on Website

1. **Upload to website** (see Option 1 above)

2. **Visit URL:**
   ```
   https://www.tradesmatepro.com/quote.html?id=YOUR_QUOTE_ID
   ```

3. **Test approval:**
   - Click "Approve Quote"
   - Should see success message
   - Check database - status should be 'approved'

## 🔐 SECURITY NOTES

### What's Secure ✅
- ✅ Uses Supabase anon key (safe for public use)
- ✅ Only shows quotes with status='sent'
- ✅ Customer can only approve/reject (not edit amounts)
- ✅ Quote ID is required (can't browse all quotes)

### What's NOT Secure ⚠️
- ⚠️ Anyone with the link can approve/reject
- ⚠️ No authentication required

### Recommended Improvements (Future):
1. Add magic link authentication
2. Require customer email verification
3. Add expiration date to links
4. Log IP addresses for approvals

**For now:** This is fine for testing. The quote ID acts as a "secret token" - only customers who receive the email will have it.

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Quote not found"
**Cause:** Quote ID is wrong or quote status is not 'sent'  
**Fix:** 
- Check quote ID is correct
- Make sure quote status is 'sent' in database

### Issue: "Error loading quote"
**Cause:** Supabase connection issue  
**Fix:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase URL and anon key are correct

### Issue: "Approve button doesn't work"
**Cause:** RLS policy might be blocking update  
**Fix:**
- Check RLS policies on work_orders table
- Make sure anon users can UPDATE quotes with status='sent'

### Issue: Page shows but no data
**Cause:** CORS or network issue  
**Fix:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Verify Supabase is accessible

---

## 📊 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CUSTOMER APPROVES

1. **Customer clicks "Approve Quote"**
2. **JavaScript updates database:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE work_orders 
   SET status = 'approved', 
       quote_approved_at = NOW() 
   WHERE id = 'quote-id';
   ```
3. **Success message shows**
4. **In your main app:**
   - Quote moves from "Sent" to "Approved"
   - You can see it in Quotes page
   - You can schedule the job
