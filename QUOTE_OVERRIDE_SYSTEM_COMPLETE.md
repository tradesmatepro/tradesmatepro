## 📋 Features Implemented

### **1. SendQuoteModal - Advanced Options Panel**

**Location:** `src/components/SendQuoteModal.js`

**New UI Controls:**
- ✅ **Scheduling Mode** (4 options):
  - Use Default Settings (customer picks from normal business hours)
  - Custom Schedule for This Quote (override days/hours for emergency/weekend work)
  - Company Will Schedule (customer can't pick time - you'll call them)
  - Auto-Schedule ASAP (automatically book earliest available slot)

- ✅ **Custom Schedule Options** (when "Custom Schedule" selected):
  - Available Days: Checkboxes for Mon-Sun (e.g., enable Saturday/Sunday for emergency work)
  - Start Time: Time picker (e.g., 7:00 AM for early start)
  - End Time: Time picker (e.g., 8:00 PM for late availability)

- ✅ **Deposit Options**:
  - Require Deposit checkbox (override company default)
  - Deposit Required BEFORE Scheduling checkbox
  - Allowed Payment Methods: Multi-select (Online/Cash/Check)

**How to Access:**
1. Click "Send Quote" on any quote
2. Scroll down and click "Advanced Options (Scheduling & Deposit Overrides)"
3. Configure per-quote settings
4. Send quote

---

### **2. QuotesPro.js - Save Overrides to Database**

**Location:** `src/pages/QuotesPro.js`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Loads company settings on mount
- ✅ Passes `companySettings` prop to SendQuoteModal
- ✅ Saves all override fields to `work_orders` table when quote is sent
- ✅ Logs override data for debugging

**Database Update:**
```javascript
{
  status: 'sent',
  quote_sent_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  
  // Scheduling overrides
  scheduling_mode: 'custom_schedule',
  custom_availability_days: ['saturday', 'sunday'],
  custom_availability_hours_start: '07:00',
  custom_availability_hours_end: '20:00',
  
  // Deposit overrides
  deposit_required: true,
  deposit_required_before_scheduling: false,
  allowed_payment_methods: ['cash', 'check']
}
```

---

### **3. quote.html - Apply Overrides in Customer Portal**

**Location:** `quote.html`

**Changes:**

#### **A. Approval Wizard Logic**
- ✅ Reads `scheduling_mode` from quote data
- ✅ Skips scheduling step if `scheduling_mode = 'company_schedules'`
- ✅ Checks `deposit_required` override before company default
- ✅ Logs all override values for debugging

#### **B. Deposit Step**
- ✅ Filters payment methods based on `allowed_payment_methods` array
- ✅ Only shows methods contractor allowed for this quote
- ✅ Defaults to first allowed method

**Example:**
```javascript
// If quote has allowed_payment_methods: ['cash', 'check']
// Customer only sees:
// - 💵 Cash (Pay on arrival)
// - 🏦 Check (Pay on arrival)
// - ✅ Already Paid
// (Online payment option is hidden)
```

#### **C. Scheduling Widget**
- ✅ Creates `effectiveSettings` object merging company defaults + quote overrides
- ✅ Overrides `business_days` if `custom_availability_days` exists
- ✅ Overrides `business_hours_start` if `custom_availability_hours_start` exists
- ✅ Overrides `business_hours_end` if `custom_availability_hours_end` exists
- ✅ Passes effective settings to SchedulingWidget

**Example:**
```javascript
// Company default: Mon-Fri, 8 AM - 5 PM
// Quote override: Sat-Sun, 7 AM - 8 PM
// Customer sees: Weekend slots from 7 AM to 8 PM
```
