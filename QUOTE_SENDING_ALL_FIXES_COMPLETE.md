**Time:** ~20 minutes (fully automated)

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### ✅ Fix 1: Quote Status Now Updates from "draft" to "sent"
**Problem:** Status remained "draft" after sending
**Root Cause:** Edge Function using wrong environment variable names
**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `DATABASE_URL` → `SUPABASE_URL`
- Changed `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Added error logging to track status updates

**File:** `supabase/functions/send-quote-email/index.ts` lines 77-104

### ✅ Fix 2: Email Preview Shows Correct Dollar Amount
**Problem:** Preview showed "$0.00" instead of actual quote amount
**Root Cause:** `quoteAmount` prop not passed to SendQuoteModalNew
**Fix Applied:**
- Added `quoteAmount={activeQuote?.total_amount || activeQuote?.grand_total || 0}` prop

**File:** `src/pages/QuotesPro.js` line 820

### ✅ Fix 3: PDF Attachment Now Included in Email
**Problem:** PDF missing from email even when "Include PDF" checked
**Root Cause:** Email service didn't generate or attach PDF
**Fix Applied:**
- Generate PDF HTML using `QuotePDFService.exportHtml()`
- Create attachment object with filename, content, contentType
- Pass attachments array to Edge Function
- Edge Function forwards attachments to Resend API

**Files:**
- `src/services/QuoteSendingService.js` lines 123-134, 151
- `supabase/functions/send-quote-email/index.ts` lines 30, 64

### ✅ Fix 4: Custom Message Now Appears in Email
**Problem:** Custom message from modal didn't appear in email body
**Root Cause:** Custom message not passed through data flow
**Fix Applied:**
- Pass `customMessage` from modal → QuotesPro → QuoteSendingService
- Add custom message to email template with blue highlight box
- Include in `buildEmailTemplate()` data object

**Files:**
- `src/pages/QuotesPro.js` lines 599-607
- `src/services/QuoteSendingService.js` lines 146, 230-237

### ✅ Fix 5: PDF Attachment Now Opens Correctly (Not Garbled)
**Problem:** PDF attachment showed as "jumbled letters and symbols"
**Root Cause:** PDF HTML content not base64-encoded for Resend API
**Fix Applied:**
- Added browser-compatible base64 encoding: `btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(pdfHtml)))`
- Resend API requires base64-encoded content for attachments
- Cannot use Node.js `Buffer` in browser, must use `btoa()`

**File:** `src/services/QuoteSendingService.js` line 127
