## ✅ **FIX 1: DELETE EMPLOYEE NOW REMOVES auth.users**

### **Problem:**
When deleting an employee, the delete button only removed records from business tables (`employees`, `users`, `profiles`) but NOT from `auth.users` (Supabase Auth). This caused "user already exists" errors when trying to recreate employees with the same email.

### **Solution:**
Updated `deleteEmployee()` function in `src/pages/Employees.js` (lines 988-1072) to:

1. **Get auth_user_id** from users table first
2. **Delete from auth.users** (Supabase Auth) FIRST using the auth_user_id
3. **Delete from employees** table (cascades to related records)
4. **Delete from profiles** table
5. **Delete from users** table (main record)

### **Key Changes:**
- Added comprehensive logging for each deletion step
- Proper error handling for auth deletion
- Correct order: auth.users → employees → profiles → users
- Uses correct `auth_user_id` instead of `employeeId`

### **Test:**
1. Go to Employees page
2. Delete Brad Hansell
3. Recreate Brad with same email
4. **Should work now!** ✅

## ✅ **FIX 2: PROFILE CREATED FOR JERRY SMITH**

### **Problem:**
```
GET .../profiles?user_id=eq.44475f47-be87-45ef-b465-2ecbbc0616ea 406 (Not Acceptable)
⚠️ Profile not found, using defaults
```

The code was querying the `profiles` table for Jerry Smith (user_id: 44475f47...) but no profile record existed, causing 406 errors.

### **Solution:**
Created SQL script (`fix_profile.sql`) and executed it to insert profile record for Jerry Smith with:
- user_id: `44475f47-be87-45ef-b465-2ecbbc0616ea`
- timezone: `America/Los_Angeles`
- language: `en`
- notification_preferences: `{"email": true, "sms": false, "push": true}`

### **Result:**
```
NOTICE: Profile created for Jerry Smith
```

### **Test:**
Refresh the app - 406 profile errors should be gone! ✅

## ✅ **FIX 3: PTO LOADING DISABLED**

### **Problem:**
```
GET .../pto_policies?order=created_at.desc&select=* 404 (Not Found)
GET .../pto_ledger?order=created_at.desc&limit=100&select=* 404 (Not Found)
```

The Employees page was trying to load PTO data from `pto_policies` and `pto_ledger` tables, but these tables don't exist in the database yet.

### **Solution:**
Commented out `loadPTOData()` call in `src/pages/Employees.js` (line 202):

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  loadEmployees();
  // loadPTOData(); // ❌ DISABLED: PTO tables don't exist yet - uncomment when tables are created
}, [user?.company_id]);
```

### **Result:**
404 errors for PTO tables are eliminated. Can be re-enabled when PTO tables are created.

### **Test:**
Check console - no more 404 errors for pto_policies or pto_ledger! ✅

## ✅ **FIX 4: PASSWORD RESET FUNCTIONALITY ADDED**

### **Problem:**
- Temp password worked for initial login ✅
- But no way for employees to change their password!
- "Reset Password" button in MyProfile page was not implemented (just showed "will be implemented" message)

### **Solution:**
Implemented full password change functionality in `src/pages/MyProfile.js`:

### **New Features:**

#### **1. Password Change Modal** (lines 1309-1431)
- Modern full-screen modal with primary-600 header
- Three input fields:
  - Current Password (required)
  - New Password (min 8 chars, required)
  - Confirm New Password (must match)
- Password requirements displayed
- Loading state with spinner
- Cancel and submit buttons

#### **2. Password Change Handler** (lines 270-335)
```javascript
const handlePasswordChange = async (e) => {
  // Step 1: Verify current password by attempting sign in
  const { error: signInError } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email: user.email,
    password: passwordForm.currentPassword
  });

  // Step 2: Update to new password
  const { error: updateError } = await supabase.auth.updateUser({
    password: passwordForm.newPassword
  });
}
```

#### **3. State Management** (lines 40-46)
- `showPasswordModal` - controls modal visibility
- `passwordForm` - stores current/new/confirm passwords
- `passwordLoading` - loading state during password change

### **Security Features:**
- ✅ Verifies current password before allowing change
- ✅ Validates new password length (min 8 characters)
- ✅ Confirms new password matches confirmation
- ✅ Uses Supabase Auth API for secure password updates
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

### **User Experience:**
- ✅ Clear password requirements displayed
- ✅ Loading spinner during submission
- ✅ Success/error alerts
- ✅ Form resets after successful change
- ✅ Modal closes automatically on success

### **Test:**
1. Login as Brad (or any employee)
2. Go to My Profile page
3. Scroll to "Security Settings" section
4. Click "Reset Password" button
5. Enter current password (temp password)
6. Enter new password (min 8 chars)
7. Confirm new password
8. Click "Change Password"
9. **Should see success message!** ✅
10. Logout and login with new password
11. **Should work!** ✅

## 📝 **NOTES**

### **PTO Tables:**
When you're ready to implement PTO functionality, uncomment line 202 in `src/pages/Employees.js`:
```javascript
loadPTOData(); // Uncomment when pto_policies and pto_ledger tables are created
```

### **Password Requirements:**
Current requirements are:
- Minimum 8 characters
- Recommended: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars

To enforce stricter requirements, update the validation in `handlePasswordChange()` function.

### **Admin Password Reset:**
The Employees page also has a "Reset Password" button for admins (line 2139), but it's not yet implemented. This would allow admins to generate new temp passwords for employees. Let me know if you want this implemented too!
