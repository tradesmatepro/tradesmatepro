🔹 1. Preferred Contractors (Customer-Side)

Customers (homeowners or business clients) can mark a contractor as Preferred in their profile.

Effects:

When that customer posts a new request, preferred contractors get pinged first.

They might even get a 24h early window before it goes to the wider marketplace.

If the customer enables auto-accept, preferreds can be auto-booked if they meet the thresholds.

👉 This means you’re protecting relationships. Customers keep “their guy,” but can still fall back to the open network if they need.

🔹 2. Preferred Subs (Contractor-Side)

GCs or company owners can mark subs as Preferred Vendors/Contractors.

Effects:

When they ping out for help, preferreds are offered first.

Optionally: preferred subs can be auto-accepted without bidding if they’re available.

👉 This makes the app an extension of how trades really work: good crews stick together, but there’s still flexibility.

🔹 3. Fairness Layer

Transparency: Preferred status is visible to the user who set it, not hidden.

Choice: Customers can still choose from others if preferreds aren’t available, overpriced, or underperforming.

Performance feedback: If a contractor loses preferred status, they see why (bad reviews, slow response, higher price).

🔹 4. Supabase Schema Additions

You don’t need anything heavy. Just a join table:

-- Preferred contractors set by customers
create table public.preferred_contractors (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  customer_id uuid references public.customers(id) on delete cascade,
  contractor_id uuid references public.contractors(id) on delete cascade,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  unique(customer_id, contractor_id)
);

-- Preferred subcontractors set by contractors
create table public.preferred_subs (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  contractor_id uuid references public.contractors(id) on delete cascade,
  sub_id uuid references public.contractors(id) on delete cascade,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  unique(contractor_id, sub_id)
);

🔹 5. Benefits

Customers feel safe → they keep their trusted contractor, not “lose” them to the marketplace.

Contractors feel respected → they can build loyalty and repeat business.

Marketplace still works → fills gaps when preferreds are unavailable.

Platform stays neutral → you’re not “stealing customers,” just enabling fair competition.

✅ In one line:
Preferred contractors/subs let users lock in relationships they already trust while still giving them freedom to use the open marketplace — ensuring fairness, loyalty, and transparency without the “stealing” stigma.
