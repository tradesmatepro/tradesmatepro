# Quote Modal Data Visibility - CRITICAL UX GAP

## The Problem

User correctly identified a **critical UX gap**: Modal data is being saved to the database but there's **NO VISIBILITY** of this data anywhere in the UI.

### Example Scenario:
1. User changes quote status to "Changes Requested"
2. Modal opens asking for details
3. User selects "Customer requested a discount" and adds notes
4. Modal closes, data is saved
5. **BUT THEN WHAT?** 
   - No notification
   - No alert
   - No indication on the quotes list
   - No visible feedback in the edit form
   - Just says "Changes Requested" with no details

### User's Question:
> "Where is the data for all these modals going that need feedback or changes of some type? How do the app users know? What's standard here? Alert of some type on the main page or notifications?"

**Answer**: The data is being saved to the database but there's NO UI to display it. This is a critical gap.

## Industry Standard (Jobber, ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro)

**Jobber Activity Feed**:
```

```
🔔 Notifications (3)

### 4. **Quotes List - Visual Indicators**

3. **Visual Indicators on Quotes List** - Show change details on cards

### Phase 2 (Important - Do Soon):
4. **Notifications System** - Bell icon with notification center
5. **Dashboard Widget** - Quotes requiring action

### Phase 3 (Nice to Have):
6. **Email Notifications** - Send emails on status changes
7. **Mobile Push Notifications** - For mobile app (future)

## User's Specific Issue

**What happened**:
1. User changed quote to "Changes Requested"
2. Selected "Customer requested a discount"
3. Saved and closed
4. **NO FEEDBACK** - Just says "Changes Requested" with no details

**What should happen**:
1. User changes quote to "Changes Requested"
2. Modal opens, user enters details
3. Modal closes, data is saved
4. **Status Card appears** showing:
   ```
   📋 Status: Changes Requested
   Change Type: Pricing
   Details: Customer requested a discount
   Urgency: High
   Follow-up: Oct 10, 2025
   ```
5. **Notification appears** in notification center
6. **Dashboard widget** shows this quote in "Requiring Action"
7. **Quotes list** shows indicator: "💬 Discount requested"

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add Status Card to QuoteBuilder showing modal data
2. **Immediate**: Add Activity Timeline to quote detail view
3. **Soon**: Add Notifications system
4. **Soon**: Add Dashboard widget

This is a **critical UX issue** that makes the modal data essentially useless. Users have no way to see what was entered or act on it.
