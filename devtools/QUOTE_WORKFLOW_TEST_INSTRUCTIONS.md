# üß™ Quote Workflow Testing Instructions

## What Was Fixed

You reported that quote status changes (approved, rejected, follow_up, changes_requested) were doing nothing. The root cause was that `QuotesPro.js` was just doing a simple status update without showing any modals or capturing required data.

**I've now implemented the complete workflow system with proper modals and data capture.**

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Added Modal State Management**
- `showApprovalModal` - For approved status
- `showRejectionModal` - For rejected status  
- `showChangesRequestedModal` - For changes_requested status
- `showFollowUpModal` - For follow_up status
- `quoteForAction` - Stores the quote being acted upon

### 2. **Created Workflow Handler**
- `handleQuoteStatusChange()` - Intercepts status changes and shows appropriate modals
- Replaces the old `setActiveQuoteStatus()` which just did a dumb PATCH

### 3. **Added Modal Confirmation Handlers**
- `handleApprovalConfirm()` - Captures approval data, prompts to schedule job
- `handleRejectionConfirm()` - Captures rejection reason, competitor info, optionally schedules follow-up
- `handleChangesRequestedConfirm()` - Captures change types, details, urgency
- `handleFollowUpConfirm()` - Captures follow-up date/time/method, creates task in database

### 4. **Fixed Status Enum Values**
- Changed from uppercase `ACCEPTED`/`REJECTED` to lowercase `approved`/`rejected` to match database

### 5. **Updated Modal JSX**
- Fixed modal components to use `quoteForAction` instead of undefined state variables

## üîç Verify Database Updates

After testing, check the database to verify data was saved:

```sql
-- Check approval data
SELECT 
  work_order_number, 
  status, 
  customer_approved_at, 
  approval_method, 
  approval_notes 
FROM work_orders 
WHERE status = 'approved' 
  AND work_order_number LIKE 'WO-TEST%';

-- Check rejection data
SELECT 
  work_order_number, 
  status, 
  rejected_at, 
  rejection_reason, 
  rejection_notes,
  competitor_name,
  competitor_price
FROM work_orders 
WHERE status = 'rejected' 
  AND work_order_number LIKE 'WO-TEST%';

-- Check changes requested data
SELECT 
  work_order_number, 
  status, 
  changes_requested_at, 
  change_types, 
  change_details,
  change_urgency
FROM work_orders 
WHERE status = 'changes_requested' 
  AND work_order_number LIKE 'WO-TEST%';

-- Check follow-up data
SELECT 
  work_order_number, 
  status, 
  follow_up_scheduled_at, 
  follow_up_date,
  follow_up_time,
  follow_up_method,
  follow_up_notes
FROM work_orders 
WHERE status = 'follow_up' 
  AND work_order_number LIKE 'WO-TEST%';

-- Check follow-up tasks created
SELECT 
  wo.work_order_number,
  qf.scheduled_date,
  qf.follow_up_type,
  qf.status,
  qf.notes
FROM quote_follow_ups qf
JOIN work_orders wo ON qf.work_order_id = wo.id
WHERE wo.work_order_number LIKE 'WO-TEST%';
```

## üêõ If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Look for errors** (red text)
3. **Try the action again** and watch the console

### ‚úÖ **Beats Jobber:**
- Forces scheduling action on approval (no quotes sitting in limbo)
- Immediate prompt to schedule prevents forgotten jobs

### ‚úÖ **Beats Housecall Pro:**

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

Once you confirm these work:

1. **Test other statuses** (sent, presented, expired)
2. **Test the full pipeline** (draft ‚Üí sent ‚Üí approved ‚Üí scheduled ‚Üí completed ‚Üí invoiced ‚Üí paid ‚Üí closed)
3. **Verify calendar integration** (approved quotes should schedule on calendar)
4. **Check dashboard widgets** (follow-ups, expired quotes, etc.)
5. **Test email/SMS notifications** (future enhancement)
