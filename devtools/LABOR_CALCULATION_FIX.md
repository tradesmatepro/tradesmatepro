# ✅ LABOR CALCULATION FIX

## 🐛 Issue

When editing a quote, labor showed:
- **Hours:** 8.0h @ $75
- **Total Cost:** $0.00 ❌

The hours and rate were correct, but the total was calculating as $0.00.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Race condition between data loading and rate loading:**

1. **Quote data loads first** (line items from database)
2. **`loadLaborDataFromQuoteItems()` runs** and converts line items to labor rows
3. **BUT rates haven't loaded yet**, so it uses `rates?.hourly || 0` = **0**
4. **Calculation:** `8 hours × $0/hr = $0.00` ❌

**Code that caused the issue (QuoteBuilder.js line 322):**
```javascript
const lineTotal = (regularHours * (rates?.hourly || 0)) + (overtimeHours * (rates?.overtime || 0));
//                                  ↑ This is 0 if rates not loaded yet!
```

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

Added a new useEffect that **recalculates labor totals when rates are loaded:**

**File:** `src/components/QuoteBuilder.js`
**Lines:** 181-194

```javascript
// ✅ FIX: Recalculate labor totals when rates are loaded
useEffect(() => {
  if (rates?.hourly && rates?.overtime && laborRows.length > 0) {
    console.log('🔄 Recalculating labor totals with loaded rates:', rates);
    const updatedRows = laborRows.map(row => {
      const regularTotal = (row.regular_hours || 0) * rates.hourly;
      const overtimeTotal = (row.overtime_hours || 0) * rates.overtime;
      const lineTotal = regularTotal + overtimeTotal;
      console.log('🔄 Row recalculated:', { regularHours: row.regular_hours, overtimeHours: row.overtime_hours, lineTotal });
      return { ...row, line_total: lineTotal };
    });
    setLaborRows(updatedRows);
  }
}, [rates?.hourly, rates?.overtime]); // Run when rates are loaded
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Loading Sequence:**
1. **Quote data loads** → Labor rows created with `line_total: 0`
2. **Rates load** → useEffect triggers
3. **Labor totals recalculated** → `line_total: 8 × $75 = $600` ✅
4. **UI updates** → Shows correct total

### **Example:**
```
Before fix:
- 8.0h @ $75 → $0.00 ❌

After fix:
- 8.0h @ $75 → $600.00 ✅
```

## 🧪 Test It

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Edit WO-TEST-002** (Bathroom Remodel)
3. **Check Labor Details:**
   - Should show: 8.0h @ $75
   - Should show: **$600.00** (not $0.00)
4. **Check Labor Subtotal:**
   - Should show: **$600.00**
5. **Check Quote Total:**
   - Labor: $600
   - Materials: $600 (vanity + toilet + tile)
   - Subtotal: $1200
   - Tax (8.25%): $99
   - **Total: $1299** ✅

## 📋 Files Changed

**File:** `src/components/QuoteBuilder.js`
**Lines:** 181-194
**Change:** Added useEffect to recalculate labor totals when rates load

---

## 💡 Why This Happens

This is a common React issue called a **race condition**:
- Multiple async operations (loading data, loading settings)
- No guarantee which finishes first
- Components render with incomplete data

**Solution:** Watch for dependencies and recalculate when they're ready!

---

## ✅ What Should Work Now

1. **Labor totals calculate correctly** when editing quotes
2. **Quote subtotals include labor** properly
3. **Grand totals are accurate**
4. **No more $0.00 labor costs**

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

Test the fix and let me know if:
- ✅ Labor totals show correctly
- ✅ Quote totals are accurate
- ❌ Any other calculation issues

Then we'll fix the remaining issues:
- Timesheets showing "Unknown Employee"
- Closed jobs not showing
- Work order details not showing line items
