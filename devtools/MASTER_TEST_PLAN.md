## üéØ RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### **Option A: Continue Systematic Testing (Recommended)**
Test all 13 features one by one, document what works and what doesn't.  
**Time:** 2-3 hours  
**Benefit:** Complete picture of system status

### **Option B: Fix Known Issues First**
Fix timesheet approval, console errors, then continue testing.  
**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Benefit:** Clean up before testing more

### **Option C: Focus on High-Priority Features**
Test only the most critical features (timesheets, scheduling, customers).  
**Time:** 1 hour  
**Benefit:** Faster feedback on critical features

## üí° MY RECOMMENDATION

**Do Option A - Continue Systematic Testing**

Reasons:
1. We need to know what's broken before we can fix it
2. Testing will reveal the scope of work needed
3. We can prioritize fixes based on what's most broken
4. Full picture helps with planning

**Next Steps:**
1. Expand deep functional test to cover all 13 features
2. Run comprehensive test (15-20 minutes)
3. Generate detailed report of what works/doesn't work
4. Prioritize fixes based on business impact
5. Fix systematically, no bandaids
