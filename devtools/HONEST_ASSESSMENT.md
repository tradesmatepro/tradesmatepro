## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED

### **ISSUE #1: Database is Mostly Empty** 🔴🔴🔴

**Problem:**
- Only 2 customers
- Only 2 employees
- 1 work order (on_hold)
- 0 invoices
- 0 vendors
- 0 inventory
- 0 timesheets (or table broken)

**Why This Happened:**
- Pipeline test created data but it was deleted?
- Or pipeline test didn't actually save data?
- Or data was created in wrong company_id?

**Impact:** Can't test features without data!

---

### **ISSUE #2: employee_timesheets Table Missing company_id** 🔴🔴🔴

**Problem:**
```
ERROR: column "company_id" does not exist
LINE 1: ...FROM employee_timesheets WHERE company_id...
```

**Impact:**
- Can't query timesheets by company
- Timesheets page may be broken
- Multi-tenant security issue!

**Fix Required:**
1. Add company_id column to employee_timesheets
2. Update all timesheet queries
3. Add RLS policies

---

### **ISSUE #3: Inventory Shows Wrong Data** 🔴🔴

**Problem:**
- Database has 0 inventory items
- But page shows 39 items!

**Possible Causes:**
1. Querying wrong table
2. Showing sample/demo data
3. Query not filtering by company_id

**Fix Required:** Check inventory page query

---

### **ISSUE #4: Payroll Shows Employees, Not Payroll Runs** 🔴🔴

**Problem:**
- Page shows 2 items (employees)
- Should show payroll runs, not employees

**Fix Required:** Fix payroll page query

---

### **ISSUE #5: Work Order Doesn't Display** 🔴

**Problem:**
- 1 work order exists in database
- But doesn't display on work orders page

**Possible Causes:**
1. Query filtering it out (status filter?)
2. RLS policy blocking it
3. Page query broken

**Fix Required:** Check work orders page query
