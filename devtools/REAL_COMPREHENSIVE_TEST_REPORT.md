## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### **ISSUE #1: Work Orders Don't Display** 🔴🔴🔴

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Main feature doesn't work!

**Problem:**
- Work Orders page shows NO DATA
- But we created work orders in pipeline test
- Where did they go?

**Possible Causes:**
1. Work orders created in wrong table
2. Work orders filtered out (company_id mismatch?)
3. Work orders page query broken
4. RLS policies blocking data

**Need to Check:**
1. Query database directly: `SELECT * FROM work_orders WHERE company_id = 'cf619000-fa5b-4aeb-ae97-a2b5eb1dae8e'`
2. Check work_orders page query
3. Check RLS policies

---

### **ISSUE #2: Invoices Don't Display** 🔴🔴🔴

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Can't see invoices!

**Problem:**
- Invoices page shows NO DATA
- But we created invoices in pipeline test
- Where did they go?

**Need to Check:**
1. Query database: `SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE company_id = 'cf619000-fa5b-4aeb-ae97-a2b5eb1dae8e'`
2. Check invoices page query
3. Check if invoices are in work_orders table instead

---

### **ISSUE #3: Quotes Don't Display** 🔴🔴

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Can't see quotes!

**Problem:**
- Quotes page shows "No quotes found"
- But we created quotes in pipeline test

2. Is quotes page querying correctly?

---

### **ISSUE #4: Scheduling Shows No Events** 🔴🔴

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Calendar is empty!

**Problem:**
- Calendar renders but NO EVENTS
- No scheduled jobs display

**Need to Check:**
1. Query: `SELECT * FROM schedule_events WHERE company_id = 'cf619000-fa5b-4aeb-ae97-a2b5eb1dae8e'`
2. Or are scheduled jobs in work_orders with start_time?

---

### **ISSUE #5: Timesheets Don't Display** 🔴

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Can't see timesheets!

**Problem:**
- "No Timesheets Found" message
- But we created timesheets in test

**Need to Check:**
1. Query: `SELECT * FROM employee_timesheets WHERE company_id = 'cf619000-fa5b-4aeb-ae97-a2b5eb1dae8e'`
2. Check if timesheets were actually saved
