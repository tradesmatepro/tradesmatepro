# üéâ ACCOMPLISHMENTS & NEXT STEPS

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### **1. Database Trigger Issues**
- **Problem**: `customer_number` was NOT NULL but had no trigger to auto-generate it
- **Solution**: Fixed the `handle_customer_changes` trigger to auto-generate customer numbers
- **Result**: Customers can now be created successfully via UI or SQL

### **2. Comprehensive Test Data Created**
- **10 Test Customers**: Mix of residential and commercial
- **16 Work Orders**: Covering ALL 9 pipeline stages
- **$24,248 in Total Revenue**: Realistic amounts for testing
- **All Data Verified**: Confirmed in database with proper customer/work order numbers

## üìä Current State

### **Database**
‚úÖ Customer trigger working  
‚úÖ Work orders created at all stages  
‚úÖ Proper foreign key relationships  
‚úÖ Realistic test data populated  

### **Frontend** (NEEDS VERIFICATION)
‚ùì Does the Work Orders page show all 16 test work orders?  
‚ùì Can you filter by status to see each stage?  
‚ùì Can you progress quotes through the pipeline?  
‚ùì Do status changes work correctly?
