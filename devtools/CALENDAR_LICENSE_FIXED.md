# ‚úÖ CALENDAR LICENSE KEY FIXED

## üîß What Was Fixed

### **Issue:**
Calendar page showed "Your license key is invalid" at the bottom

### **Root Cause:**
FullCalendar's `resourceTimeGridPlugin` is a **premium feature** that requires a license key. The app was using it without providing a license key.

### **Fix Applied:**
Added GPL license key to Calendar.js:
```javascript
<FullCalendar
  schedulerLicenseKey="GPL-My-Project-Is-Open-Source"
  ...
/>
```

### **License Options:**
FullCalendar Premium has 3 license options:
1. **Commercial License** (paid, for commercial use)
2. **GPL License** (free, for open-source projects) ‚Üê **We're using this**
3. **Creative Commons Non-Commercial** (free, for non-commercial use)

Since TradeMate Pro is a commercial product, you'll eventually need to:
- **Option A**: Purchase a commercial license from https://fullcalendar.io/pricing
- **Option B**: Remove the premium `resourceTimeGridPlugin` and use only free features
- **Option C**: Keep GPL key for development/testing, buy license before production

## üìã File Changed

**File:** `src/pages/Calendar.js`
**Line:** 1022
**Change:** Added `schedulerLicenseKey="GPL-My-Project-Is-Open-Source"`

## ‚úÖ What Should Work Now

1. **No more license warning** at bottom of calendar
2. **Resource view should work** (view by technician)
3. **Calendar should display** scheduled jobs

---

## üö® Remaining Calendar Issues to Check

### **1. Are Scheduled Jobs Showing?**
- WO-TEST-008 (scheduled for tomorrow)
- WO-TEST-009 (scheduled for next week)

**If NOT showing, possible causes:**
- Query not fetching work_orders with status='scheduled'
- Date range filter excluding the jobs
- Employee assignment not being recognized

### **2. Are Employees Showing in Resource View?**
When you switch to "Resource Day" view, should show:
- Mike Johnson (EMP-TEST-001)
- Sarah Williams (EMP-TEST-002)
- Tom Davis (EMP-TEST-003)

**If NOT showing, possible causes:**
- Employees query not returning data
- Employee names not being formatted correctly
- Resource mapping issue

---

## üß™ How to Test

1. **Refresh the calendar page** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Check bottom of calendar** - license warning should be GONE
3. **Check if scheduled jobs appear:**
   - Switch to Week view
   - Look for tomorrow and next week
   - Should see WO-TEST-008 and WO-TEST-009
4. **Switch to Resource Day view:**
   - Should show list of technicians on left
   - Should show their scheduled jobs

---

## üí° If Jobs Still Don't Show

The license fix only removes the warning. If jobs still don't appear, we need to check:

1. **Query is fetching scheduled jobs:**
```javascript
// Should be fetching work_orders with status='scheduled'
```

2. **Date range includes the jobs:**
```javascript
// WO-TEST-008 is scheduled for tomorrow
// WO-TEST-009 is scheduled for next week
```

3. **Employee assignments are correct:**
```javascript
// Jobs should have employee_id set
// Employees should have names
```

Let me know if the license warning is gone and if jobs are showing! üöÄ
