## üîç Common Debugging Workflows

### Workflow 1: Debug the OnHold Modal Issue

**Step 1: Read the logs**
```bash
view logs.md
```

**Step 2: Look for debug logs**
Search for lines starting with `üîç` - these are our custom debug logs.

**Step 3: Get AI context**
```bash
view error_logs/ai_context.json
```

**Step 4: Analyze the issue**
Look at the status transition logic in the logs.

**Step 5: Read the relevant code**
```bash
view src/components/JobsDatabasePanel.js
```

**Step 6: Suggest a fix**
Use `str-replace-editor` to apply the fix.

**Step 7: Verify the fix**
Wait 30 seconds, then check logs.md again to see if the issue is resolved.

---

### Workflow 2: Run Complete Pipeline Test

**Step 1: Check if servers are running**
Send command:
```json
{
  "id": "cmd_status_check",
  "command": "check_status",
  "params": {},
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T01:30:00.000Z"
}
```

**Step 2: Read response**
```bash
view devtools/ai_responses.json
```

**Step 3: If servers are running, run tests**
Send command:
```json
{
  "id": "cmd_test_pipeline",
  "command": "test_pipeline",
  "params": {
    "workflow": "complete_pipeline"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T01:30:00.000Z"
}
```

**Step 4: Wait for results**
Check `devtools/ai_responses.json` after 30 seconds.

**Step 5: Analyze failures**
If tests fail, read the error details and suggest fixes.

---

### Workflow 3: Analyze All Current Errors

**Step 1: Get AI context**
```bash
view error_logs/ai_context.json
```

**Step 2: Review error summary**
Look at:
- `summary.totalErrors`
- `summary.errorsByType`
- `suggestions`

**Step 3: Prioritize issues**
Focus on `critical` priority suggestions first.

**Step 4: For each issue:**
1. Read the relevant code file
2. Understand the root cause
3. Suggest a fix
4. Apply the fix using `str-replace-editor`
5. Verify the fix worked

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Always Check Logs First
Before asking the user anything, read `logs.md` and `error_logs/ai_context.json`.

### Tip 2: Use Debug Logs
Look for logs starting with `üîç` - these are custom debug logs we added.

### Tip 3: Generate Unique Command IDs
Use timestamp + random: `cmd_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`

### Tip 4: Wait Between Commands
After sending a command, wait 1-2 seconds before reading the response.

### Tip 5: Check Status First
Before running tests, use `check_status` to ensure servers are running.

### Tip 6: Read Code Before Fixing
Always read the relevant code file before suggesting a fix.

### Tip 7: Verify Fixes
After applying a fix, wait 30 seconds and check logs.md to verify it worked.

## üö® Important Notes

### Security
- You can only read files within the project directory
- SQL execution requires explicit approval
- Always verify file paths before reading

### File Watching
- The command executor watches `ai_commands.json` for changes
- Responses appear in `ai_responses.json` within 1-2 seconds
- Old responses are kept (last 100)

### Error Handling
- If a command fails, check the response for error details
- Unknown commands return a list of available commands
- Always include required params
