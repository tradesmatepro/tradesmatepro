## ❌ ISSUES DISCOVERED

### **Issue #1: Accept Button Outside Viewport**

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Blocks quote approval workflow  
**Frequency:** 10/10 attempts (100%)

**Error Details:**
```
locator.click: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
- element is visible, enabled and stable
- scrolling into view if needed
- done scrolling
- element is outside of the viewport
```

**Root Cause:**  
The "Accept" button on the quote detail page is positioned outside the viewport after scrolling, preventing Playwright from clicking it.

**Affected Workflows:**
- ❌ Quote approval
- ❌ Job scheduling
- ❌ Invoice creation
- ❌ Payment recording
- ❌ Job closure

**Recommendation:**  
Fix the quote detail page layout to ensure action buttons remain within the viewport. Consider:
1. Sticky button footer
2. Better scroll positioning
3. Ensure buttons are always accessible

### **Issue #2: Inventory Page Missing Add Button**

**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Cannot create inventory items via UI  
**Frequency:** 10/10 attempts (100%)

**Error Details:**
No "Add Item", "New Item", or "Create Item" button found on inventory page.

**Recommendation:**  
Add inventory creation UI or verify the button selector.
