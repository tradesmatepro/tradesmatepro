# 🔐 QUOTE PORTAL RLS FIX - COMPLETE!

**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Issue:** 404 error when customers try to view quotes (RLS blocking anonymous access)  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED

### Problem:
- Customers received email with quote link
- Clicking link showed: "Quote not found or already processed"
- Console showed: 404 error from Supabase
- **Root Cause:** RLS (Row Level Security) was blocking anonymous users from viewing quotes

### Solution:
Created RLS policies to allow anonymous users to:
1. ✅ **View quotes** with status='sent'
2. ✅ **Update quotes** from 'sent' to 'approved' or 'rejected'
3. ✅ **View customers** associated with sent quotes
4. ✅ **View companies** associated with sent quotes
5. ✅ **View line items** for sent quotes

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Still getting 404 error
**Fix:** Hard refresh the portal page (Ctrl + Shift + R)

### Issue: "Quote not found"
**Possible causes:**
1. Quote status is not 'sent' (check database)
2. Quote ID is wrong (check email link)
3. RLS policies not applied (re-run SQL)

**Check database:**
```sql
SELECT id, status FROM work_orders WHERE id = 'your-quote-id';
```

### Issue: Can't approve quote
**Possible causes:**
1. Quote status is not 'sent'
2. RLS update policy not working

**Check RLS policies:**

SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'work_orders' AND policyname LIKE 'anon%';
```
